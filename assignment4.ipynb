One day she was sitting there, all by\\r\\nherself, it was very still. Suddenly, she heard a little _tap, tap,\\r\\ntap_, at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is that?\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s the Rain, I want to come in,\" said a soft, sad, little voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, you can\\'t come in,\" the little Tulip said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy by she heard another little _tap, tap, tap_ on the window-pane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is there?\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same soft little voice answered, \"It\\'s the Rain, I want to come\\r\\nin!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, you can\\'t come in,\" said the little Tulip.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen it was very still for a long time. At last, there came a little\\r\\nrustling, whispering sound, all round the window: _rustle, whisper,\\r\\nwhisper_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is there?\" said the little Tulip.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s the Sunshine,\" said a little, soft, cheery voice, \"I want to\\r\\ncome in!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"N--no,\" said the little Tulip, \"you can\\'t come in.\" And she sat still\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nPretty soon she heard the sweet little rustling noise at the keyhole.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is there?\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s the Sunshine,\" said the cheery little voice, \"I want to come\\r\\nin, I want to come in!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" said the little Tulip, \"you cannot come in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy by, as she sat so still, she heard _tap, tap, tap_, _rustle,\\r\\nwhisper, rustle_, up down the window-pane, on the door at\\r\\nthe keyhole.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Who is there?_\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s the Rain the Sun, the Rain the Sun,\" said two little\\r\\nvoices, together, \"we want to come in! We want to come in! We want\\r\\nto come in!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear, dear!\" said the little Tulip, \"if there are two of you, I s\\'pose\\r\\nI shall have to let you in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she opened the door a little wee crack, in they came. And one\\r\\ntook one of her little hands, the other took her other little hand,\\r\\nthey ran, ran, ran with her right up to the top of the ground. Then\\r\\nthey said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poke your head through!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she poked her head through; she was in the midst of a beautiful\\r\\ngarden. It was early springtime, few other flowers were to be seen;\\r\\nbut she had the birds to sing to her the sun to shine upon her\\r\\npretty yellow head. She was so pleased, too, when the children exclaimed\\r\\nwith pleasure that now they knew that the beautiful spring had come!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE COCK-A-DOO-DLE-DOO\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA very little boy made this story up \"out of his head,\" told it to\\r\\nhis papa. I think you littlest ones will like it; I do.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time there was a little boy, he wanted to be a\\r\\ncock-a-doo-dle-doo. So he was a cock-a-doo-dle-doo. And he wanted to fly\\r\\nup into the sky. So he did fly up into the sky. And he wanted to get\\r\\nwings a tail So he did get some wings a tail.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CLOUD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne hot summer morning a little Cloud rose out of the sea floated\\r\\nlightly happily across the blue sky. Far below lay the earth, brown,\\r\\ndry, desolate, from drought. The little Cloud could see the poor\\r\\npeople of the earth working suffering in the hot fields, while she\\r\\nherself floated on the morning breeze, hither thither, without a\\r\\ncare.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, if I could only help the poor people down there!\" she thought. \"If\\r\\nI could but make their work easier, or give the hungry ones food, or the\\r\\nthirsty a drink!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as the day passed, the Cloud became larger, this wish to do\\r\\nsomething for the people of earth was ever greater in her heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn earth it grew hotter hotter; the sun burned down so fiercely that\\r\\nthe people were fainting in its rays; it seemed as if they must die of\\r\\nheat, yet they were obliged to go on with their work, for they were\\r\\nvery poor. Sometimes they stood looked up at the Cloud, as if they\\r\\nwere praying, saying, \"Ah, if you could help us!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will help you; I will!\" said the Cloud. And she began to sink softly\\r\\ndown toward the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut suddenly, as she floated down, she remembered something which had\\r\\nbeen told her when she was a tiny Cloud-child, in the lap of Mother\\r\\nOcean: it had been whispered that if the Clouds go too near the earth\\r\\nthey die. When she remembered this she held herself from sinking, and\\r\\nswayed here there on the breeze, thinking,--thinking. But at last\\r\\nshe stood quite still, spoke boldly proudly. She said, \"Men of\\r\\nearth, I will help you, come what may!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thought made her suddenly marvellously big strong powerful.\\r\\nNever had she dreamed that she could be so big. Like a mighty angel of\\r\\nblessing she stood above the earth, lifted her head spread her\\r\\nwings far over the fields woods. She was so great, so majestic, that\\r\\nmen animals were awe-struck at the sight; the trees the grasses\\r\\nbowed before her; yet all the earth-creatures felt that she meant them\\r\\nwell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I will help you,\" cried the Cloud once more. \"Take me to\\r\\nyourselves; I will give my life for you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she said the words a wonderful light glowed from her heart, the sound\\r\\nof thunder rolled through the sky, a love greater than words can\\r\\ntell filled the Cloud; down, down, close to the earth she swept, and\\r\\ngave up her life in a blessed, healing shower of rain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat rain was the Cloud\\'s great deed; it was her death, too; but it was\\r\\nalso her glory. Over the whole country-side, as far as the rain fell, a\\r\\nlovely rainbow sprang its arch, all the brightest rays of heaven\\r\\nmade its colours; it was the last greeting of a love so great that it\\r\\nsacrificed itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon that, too, was gone, but long, long afterward the men animals\\r\\nwho were saved by the Cloud kept her blessing in their hearts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LITTLE RED HEN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Red Hen was in the farmyard with her chickens, when she found\\r\\na grain of wheat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who will plant this wheat?\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not I,\" said the Goose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not I,\" said the Duck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will, then,\" said the little Red Hen, she planted the grain of\\r\\nwheat.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the wheat was ripe she said, \"Who will take this wheat to the\\r\\nmill?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not I,\" said the Goose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not I,\" said the Duck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will, then,\" said the little Red Hen, she took the wheat to the\\r\\nmill.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she brought the flour home she said, \"Who will make some bread with\\r\\nthis flour?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not I,\" said the Goose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not I,\" said the Duck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will, then,\" said the little Red Hen.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the bread was baked, she said, \"Who will eat this bread?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will,\" said the Goose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will,\" said the Duck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, you won\\'t,\" said the little Red Hen. \"I shall eat it myself. Cluck!\\r\\ncluck!\" And she called her chickens to help her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GINGERBREAD MAN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time there was a little old woman a little old man, and\\r\\nthey lived all alone in a little old house. They hadn\\'t any little\\r\\ngirls or any little boys, at all. So one day, the little old woman made\\r\\na boy out of gingerbread; she made him a chocolate jacket, put\\r\\nraisins on it for buttons; his eyes were made of fine, fat currants; his\\r\\nmouth was made of rose-coloured sugar; he had a gay little cap of\\r\\norange sugar-candy. When the little old woman had rolled him out, and\\r\\ndressed him up, pinched his gingerbread shoes into shape, she put\\r\\nhim in a pan; then she put the pan in the oven shut the door; and\\r\\nshe thought, \"Now I shall have a little boy of my own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it was time for the Gingerbread Boy to be done she opened the oven\\r\\ndoor pulled out the pan. Out jumped the little Gingerbread Boy on to\\r\\nthe floor, away he ran, out of the door down the street! The\\r\\nlittle old woman the little old man ran after him as fast as they\\r\\ncould, but he just laughed, shouted,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Run! run! as fast as you can!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t catch me, I\\'m the Gingerbread Man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd they couldn\\'t catch him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Gingerbread Boy ran on on, until he came to a cow, by the\\r\\nroadside. \"Stop, little Gingerbread Boy,\" said the cow; \"I want to eat\\r\\nyou.\" The little Gingerbread Boy laughed said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have run away from a little old woman,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And a little old man,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I can run away from you, I can!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, as the cow chased him, he looked over his shoulder cried,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Run! run! as fast as you can!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t catch me, I\\'m the Gingerbread Man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the cow couldn\\'t catch him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Gingerbread Boy ran on, on, on, till he came to a\\r\\nhorse, in the pasture. \"Please stop, little Gingerbread Boy,\" said the\\r\\nhorse, \"you look very good to eat.\" But the little Gingerbread Boy\\r\\nlaughed out loud. \"Oho! oho!\" he said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have run away from a little old woman,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little old man,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A cow,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I can run away from you, I can!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, as the horse chased him, he looked over his shoulder cried,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Run! run! as fast as you can!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t catch me, I\\'m the Gingerbread Man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the horse couldn\\'t catch him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy by the little Gingerbread Boy came to a barn full of threshers.\\r\\nWhen the threshers smelt the Gingerbread Boy, they tried to pick him up,\\r\\nsaid, \"Don\\'t run so fast, little Gingerbread Boy; you look very good\\r\\nto eat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the little Gingerbread Boy ran harder than ever, as he ran he\\r\\ncried out,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have run away from a little old woman,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little old man,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A cow,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A horse,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I can run away from you, I can!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when he found that he was ahead of the threshers, he turned and\\r\\nshouted back to them,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Run! run! as fast as you can!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t catch me, I\\'m the Gingerbread Man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the threshers couldn\\'t catch him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the little Gingerbread Boy ran faster than ever. He ran ran\\r\\nuntil he came to a field full of mowers. When the mowers saw how fine he\\r\\nlooked, they ran after him, calling out, \"Wait a bit! wait a bit, little\\r\\nGingerbread Boy, we wish to eat you!\" But the little Gingerbread Boy\\r\\nlaughed harder than ever, ran like the wind. \"Oho! oho!\" he said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have run away from a little old woman,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little old man,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A cow,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A horse,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A barn full of threshers,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I can run away from you, I can!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when he found that he was ahead of the mowers, he turned shouted\\r\\nback to them,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Run! run! as fast as you can!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t catch me, I\\'m the Gingerbread Man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the mowers couldn\\'t catch him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time the little Gingerbread Boy was so proud that he didn\\'t\\r\\nthink anybody could catch him. Pretty soon he saw a fox coming across a\\r\\nfield. The fox looked at him began to run. But the little\\r\\nGingerbread Boy shouted across to him, \"You can\\'t catch me!\" The fox\\r\\nbegan to run faster, the little Gingerbread Boy ran faster, as\\r\\nhe ran he chuckled,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have run away from a little old woman,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little old man,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A cow,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A horse,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A barn full of threshers,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A field full of mowers,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I can run away from you, I can!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Run! run! as fast as you can!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t catch me, I\\'m the Gingerbread Man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" said the fox, \"I would not catch you if I could. I would not\\r\\nthink of disturbing you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then, the little Gingerbread Boy came to a river. He could not swim\\r\\nacross, he wanted to keep running away from the cow the horse\\r\\nthe people.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jump on my tail, I will take you across,\" said the fox.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the little Gingerbread Boy jumped on the fox\\'s tail, the fox\\r\\nbegan to swim the river. When he was a little way from the bank he\\r\\nturned his head, said, \"You are too heavy on my tail, little\\r\\nGingerbread Boy, I fear I shall let you get wet; jump on my back.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Gingerbread Boy jumped on his back.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little farther out, the fox said, \"I am afraid the water will cover\\r\\nyou, there; jump on my shoulder.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Gingerbread Boy jumped on his shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of the stream the fox said, \"Oh, dear! little Gingerbread\\r\\nBoy, my shoulder is sinking; jump on my nose, I can hold you out of\\r\\nwater.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the little Gingerbread Boy jumped on his nose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe minute the fox reached the bank he threw back his head, gave a\\r\\nsnap!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear me!\" said the little Gingerbread Boy, \"I am a quarter gone!\" The\\r\\nnext minute he said, \"Why, I am half gone!\" The next minute he said, \"My\\r\\ngoodness gracious, I am three quarters gone!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd after that, the little Gingerbread Boy never said anything more at\\r\\nall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LITTLE JACKALS AND THE LION\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce there was a great big jungle; in the jungle there was a great\\r\\nbig Lion; the Lion was king of the jungle. Whenever he wanted\\r\\nanything to eat, all he had to do was to come up out of his cave in the\\r\\nstones earth _roar_. When he had roared a few times all the\\r\\nlittle people of the jungle were so frightened that they came out of\\r\\ntheir holes hiding-places ran, this way that, to get away.\\r\\nThen, of course, the Lion could see where they were. And he pounced on\\r\\nthem, killed them, gobbled them up.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did this so often that at last there was not a single thing left\\r\\nalive in the jungle besides the Lion, except two little Jackals,--a\\r\\nlittle father Jackal a little mother Jackal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had run away so many times that they were quite thin very\\r\\ntired, they could not run so fast any more. And one day the Lion was\\r\\nso near that the little mother Jackal grew frightened; she said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Father Jackal, Father Jackal! I b\\'lieve our time has come! the Lion\\r\\nwill surely catch us this time!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pooh! nonsense, mother!\" said the little father Jackal. \"Come, we\\'ll\\r\\nrun on a bit!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd they ran, ran, ran very fast, the Lion did not catch them that\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at last a day came when the Lion was nearer still the little\\r\\nmother Jackal was frightened almost to death.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Father Jackal, Father Jackal!\" she cried; \"I\\'m sure our time has\\r\\ncome! The Lion\\'s going to eat us this time!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, mother, don\\'t you fret,\" said the little father Jackal; \"you do\\r\\njust as I tell you, it will be all right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen what did those cunning little Jackals do but take hold of hands and\\r\\nrun up towards the Lion, as if they had meant to come all the time. When\\r\\nhe saw them coming he stood up, roared in a terrible voice,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You miserable little wretches, come here be eaten, at once! Why\\r\\ndidn\\'t you come before?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe father Jackal bowed very low.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Father Lion,\" he said, \"we meant to come before; we knew we\\r\\nought to come before; we wanted to come before; but every time we\\r\\nstarted to come, a dreadful great lion came out of the woods roared\\r\\nat us, frightened us so that we ran away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\" roared the Lion. \"There\\'s no other lion in this\\r\\njungle, you know it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, indeed, Father Lion,\" said the little Jackal, \"I know that is\\r\\nwhat everybody thinks; but indeed indeed there is another lion! And\\r\\nhe is as much bigger than you as you are bigger than I! His face is much\\r\\nmore terrible, his roar far, far more dreadful. Oh, he is far more\\r\\nfearful than you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that the Lion stood up roared so that the jungle shook.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take me to this Lion,\" he said; \"I\\'ll eat him up then I\\'ll eat you\\r\\nup.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Jackals danced on ahead, the Lion stalked behind. They\\r\\nled him to a place where there was a round, deep well of clear water.\\r\\nThey went round on one side of it, the Lion stalked up to the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He lives down there, Father Lion!\" said the little Jackal. \"He lives\\r\\ndown there!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lion came close looked down into the water,--a lion\\'s face\\r\\nlooked back at him out of the water!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he saw that, the Lion roared shook his mane showed his\\r\\nteeth. And the lion in the water shook his mane showed his teeth.\\r\\nThe Lion above shook his mane again growled again, made a\\r\\nterrible face. But the lion in the water made just as terrible a one,\\r\\nback. The Lion above couldn\\'t stthat. He leaped down into the well\\r\\nafter the other lion.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, of course, as you know very well, there wasn\\'t any other lion! It\\r\\nwas only the reflection in the water!\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the poor old Lion floundered about floundered about, as he\\r\\ncouldn\\'t get up the steep sides of the well, he was at last drowned. And\\r\\nwhen he was drowned, the little Jackals took hold of hands danced\\r\\nround the well, sang,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Lion is dead! The Lion is dead!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have killed the great Lion who would have killed us!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Lion is dead! The Lion is dead!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ao! Ao! Ao!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE COUNTRY MOUSE AND THE CITY MOUSE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce a little mouse who lived in the country invited a little mouse\\r\\nfrom the city to visit him. When the little City Mouse sat down to\\r\\ndinner he was surprised to find that the Country Mouse had nothing to\\r\\neat except barley grain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really,\" he said, \"you do not live well at all; you should see how I\\r\\nlive! I have all sorts of fine things to eat every day. You must come to\\r\\nvisit me see how nice it is to live in the city.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Country Mouse was glad to do this, after a while he went\\r\\nto the city to visit his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe very first place that the City Mouse took the Country Mouse to see\\r\\nwas the kitchen cupboard of the house where he lived. There, on the\\r\\nlowest shelf, behind some stone jars, stood a big paper bag of brown\\r\\nsugar. The little City Mouse gnawed a hole in the bag invited his\\r\\nfriend to nibble for himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two little mice nibbled nibbled, the Country Mouse thought\\r\\nhe had never tasted anything so delicious in his life. He was just\\r\\nthinking how lucky the City Mouse was, when suddenly the door opened\\r\\nwith a bang, in came the cook to get some flour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Run!\" whispered the City Mouse. And they ran as fast as they could to\\r\\nthe little hole where they had come in. The little Country Mouse was\\r\\nshaking all over when they got safely away, but the little City Mouse\\r\\nsaid, \"That is nothing; she will soon go away then we can go back.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the cook had gone away shut the door they stole softly back,\\r\\nthis time the City Mouse had something new to show: he took the\\r\\nlittle Country Mouse into a corner on the top shelf, where a big jar of\\r\\ndried prunes stood open. After much tugging pulling they got a large\\r\\ndried prune out of the jar on to the shelf began to nibble at it.\\r\\nThis was even better than the brown sugar. The little Country Mouse\\r\\nliked the taste so much that he could hardly nibble fast enough. But all\\r\\nat once, in the midst of their eating, there came a scratching at the\\r\\ndoor a sharp, loud _miaouw_!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is that?\" said the Country Mouse. The City Mouse just whispered,\\r\\n\"Sh!\" ran as fast as he could to the hole. The Country Mouse ran\\r\\nafter, you may be sure, as fast as _he_ could. As soon as they were out\\r\\nof danger the City Mouse said, \"That was the old Cat; she is the best\\r\\nmouser in town,--if she once gets you, you are lost.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is very terrible,\" said the little Country Mouse; \"let us not go\\r\\nback to the cupboard again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said the City Mouse, \"I will take you to the cellar; there is\\r\\nsomething specially fine there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the City Mouse took his little friend down the cellar stairs into\\r\\na big cupboard where there were many shelves. On the shelves were jars\\r\\nof butter, cheeses in bags out of bags. Overhead hung bunches of\\r\\nsausages, there were spicy apples in barrels standing about. It\\r\\nsmelt so good that it went to the little Country Mouse\\'s head. He ran\\r\\nalong the shelf nibbled at a cheese here, a bit of butter there,\\r\\nuntil he saw an especially rich, very delicious-smelling piece of cheese\\r\\non a queer little stin a corner. He was just on the point of putting\\r\\nhis teeth into the cheese when the City Mouse saw him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stop! stop!\" cried the City Mouse. \"That is a trap!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Country Mouse stopped said, \"What is a trap?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That thing is a trap,\" said the little City Mouse. \"The minute you\\r\\ntouch the cheese with your teeth something comes down on your head\\r\\nhard, you\\'re dead.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Country Mouse looked at the trap, he looked at the\\r\\ncheese, he looked at the little City Mouse. \"If you\\'ll excuse me,\"\\r\\nhe said, \"I think I will go home. I\\'d rather have barley grain to\\r\\neat eat it in peace comfort, than have brown sugar dried\\r\\nprunes cheese,--be frightened to death all the time!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the little Country Mouse went back to his home, there he stayed\\r\\nall the rest of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLITTLE JACK ROLLAROUND\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time there was a wee little boy who slept in a tiny\\r\\ntrundle-bed near his mother\\'s great bed. The trundle-bed had castors on\\r\\nit so that it could be rolled about, there was nothing in the world\\r\\nthe little boy liked so much as to have it rolled. When his mother came\\r\\nto bed he would cry, \"Roll me around! roll me around!\" And his mother\\r\\nwould put out her hfrom the big bed push the little bed back and\\r\\nforth till she was tired. The little boy could never get enough; so for\\r\\nthis he was called \"Little Jack Rollaround.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night he had made his mother roll him about, till she fell asleep,\\r\\neven then he kept crying, \"Roll me around! roll me around!\" His\\r\\nmother pushed him about in her sleep, until her slumber became too\\r\\nsound; then she stopped. But Little Jack Rollaround kept on crying,\\r\\n\"Roll around! roll around!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy by the Moon peeped in at the window. He saw a funny sight: Little\\r\\nJack Rollaround was lying in his trundle-bed, he had put up one\\r\\nlittle fat leg for a mast, fastened the corner of his wee shirt to\\r\\nit for a sail; he was blowing at it with all his might, saying,\\r\\n\"Roll around! roll around!\" Slowly, slowly, the little trundle-bed boat\\r\\nbegan to move; it sailed along the floor up the wall across the\\r\\nceiling down again!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"More! more!\" cried Little Jack Rollaround; the little boat sailed\\r\\nfaster up the wall, across the ceiling, down the wall, over the\\r\\nfloor. The Moon laughed at the sight; but when Little Jack Rollaround\\r\\nsaw the Moon, he called out, \"Open the door, old Moon! I want to roll\\r\\nthrough the town, so that the people can see me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Moon could not open the door, but he shone in through the keyhole,\\r\\nin a broad band. And Little Jack Rollaround sailed his trundle-bed boat\\r\\nup the beam, through the keyhole, into the street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Make a light, old Moon,\" he said; \"I want the people to see me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the good Moon made a light went along with him, the little\\r\\ntrundle-bed boat went sailing down the streets into the main street of\\r\\nthe village. They rolled past the town hall the schoolhouse the\\r\\nchurch; but nobody saw little Jack Rollaround, because everybody was in\\r\\nbed, asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why don\\'t the people come to see me?\" he shouted.\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh up on the church steeple, the Weather-vane answered, \"It is no time\\r\\nfor people to be in the streets; decent folk are in their beds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I\\'ll go to the woods, so that the animals may see me,\" said Little\\r\\nJack. \"Come along, old Moon, make a light!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good Moon went along made a light, they came to the forest.\\r\\n\"Roll! roll!\" cried the little boy; the trundle-bed went trundling\\r\\namong the trees in the great wood, scaring up the squirrels and\\r\\nstartling the little leaves on the trees. The poor old Moon began to\\r\\nhave a bad time of it, for the tree-trunks got in his way so that he\\r\\ncould not go so fast as the bed, every time he got behind, the\\r\\nlittle boy called, \"Hurry up, old Moon, I want the beasts to see me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut all the animals were asleep, nobody at all looked at Little Jack\\r\\nRollaround except an old White Owl; all she said was, \"Who are\\r\\nyou?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little boy did not like her, so he blew harder, the trundle-bed\\r\\nboat went sailing through the forest till it came to the end of the\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must go home now; it is late,\" said the Moon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will go with you; make a path!\" said Little Jack Rollaround.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kind Moon made a path up to the sky, up sailed the little bed\\r\\ninto the midst of the sky. All the little bright Stars were there with\\r\\ntheir nice little lamps. And when he saw them, that naughty Little Jack\\r\\nRollaround began to tease. \"Out of the way, there! I am coming!\" he\\r\\nshouted, sailed the trundle-bed boat straight at them. He bumped the\\r\\nlittle Stars right left, all over the sky, until every one of them\\r\\nput his little lamp out left it dark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not treat the little Stars so,\" said the good Moon.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Jack Rollaround only behaved the worse: \"Get out of the way, old\\r\\nMoon!\" he shouted, \"I am coming!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he steered the little trundle-bed boat straight into the old Moon\\'s\\r\\nface, bumped his nose!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was too much for the good Moon; he put out his big light, all at\\r\\nonce, left the sky pitch-black.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Make a light, old Moon! Make a light!\" shouted the little boy. But the\\r\\nMoon answered never a word, Jack Rollaround could not see where to\\r\\nsteer. He went rolling criss-cross, up down, all over the sky,\\r\\nknocking into the planets stumbling into the clouds, till he did not\\r\\nknow where he was.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly he saw a big yellow light at the very edge of the sky. He\\r\\nthought it was the Moon. \"Look out, I am coming!\" he cried, steered\\r\\nfor the light.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was not the kind old Moon at all; it was the great mother Sun,\\r\\njust coming up out of her home in the sea, to begin her day\\'s work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aha, youngster, what are you doing in my sky?\" she said. And she picked\\r\\nLittle Jack Rollaround up threw him, trundle-bed boat all, into\\r\\nthe middle of the sea!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I suppose he is there yet, unless somebody picked him out again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW BROTHER RABBIT FOOLED THE WHALE AND THE ELEPHANT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day little Brother Rabbit was running along on the sand, lippety,\\r\\nlippety, when he saw the Whale the Elephant talking together.\\r\\nLittle Brother Rabbit crouched down listened to what they were\\r\\nsaying. This was what they were saying:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are the biggest thing on the land, Brother Elephant,\" said the\\r\\nWhale, \"I am the biggest thing in the sea; if we join together we\\r\\ncan rule all the animals in the world, have our way about\\r\\neverything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good, very good,\" trumpeted the Elephant; \"that suits me; we will\\r\\ndo it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Brother Rabbit sniggered to himself. \"They won\\'t rule me,\" he\\r\\nsaid. He ran away got a very long, very strong rope, he got his\\r\\nbig drum, hid the drum a long way off in the bushes. Then he went\\r\\nalong the beach till he came to the Whale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, please, dear, strong Mr Whale,\" he said, \"will you have the great\\r\\nkindness to do me a favour? My cow is stuck in the mud, a quarter of a\\r\\nmile from here. And I can\\'t pull her out. But you are so strong so\\r\\nobliging, that I venture to trust you will help me out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Whale was so pleased with the compliment that he said, \"Yes,\" at\\r\\nonce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" said the Rabbit, \"I will tie this end of my long rope to you,\\r\\nI will run away tie the other end round my cow, when I am\\r\\nready I will beat my big drum. When you hear that, pull very, very\\r\\nhard, for the cow is stuck very deep in the mud.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Huh!\" grunted the Whale, \"I\\'ll pull her out, if she is stuck to the\\r\\nhorns.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Brother Rabbit tied the rope-end to the Whale, ran off,\\r\\nlippety, lippety, till he came to the place where the Elephant was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, please, mighty kindly Elephant,\" he said, making a very low\\r\\nbow, \"will you do me a favour?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it?\" asked the Elephant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My cow is stuck in the mud, about a quarter of a mile from here,\" said\\r\\nlittle Brother Rabbit, \"I cannot pull her out. Of course you could.\\r\\nIf you will be so very obliging as to help me----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" said the Elephant grandly, \"certainly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" said little Brother Rabbit, \"I will tie one end of this long\\r\\nrope to your trunk, the other to my cow, as soon as I have tied\\r\\nher tightly I will beat my big drum. When you hear that, pull; pull as\\r\\nhard as you can, for my cow is very heavy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never fear,\" said the Elephant, \"I could pull twenty cows.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure you could,\" said the Rabbit, politely, \"only be sure to begin\\r\\ngently, pull harder harder till you get her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he tied the end of the rope tightly round the Elephant\\'s trunk,\\r\\nran away into the bushes. There he sat down beat the big drum.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Whale began to pull, the Elephant began to pull, in a jiffy\\r\\nthe rope tightened till it was stretched as hard as could be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a remarkably heavy cow,\" said the Elephant; \"but I\\'ll fetch\\r\\nher!\" And he braced his forefeet in the earth, gave a tremendous\\r\\npull.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear me!\" said the Whale. \"That cow must be stuck mighty tight\"; he\\r\\ndrove his tail deep in the water, gave a marvellous pull.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pulled harder; the Elephant pulled harder. Pretty soon the Whale\\r\\nfound himself sliding toward the land. The reason was, of course, that\\r\\nthe Elephant had something solid to brace against, and, beside, as fast\\r\\nas he pulled the rope in a little, he took a turn with it round his\\r\\ntrunk!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the Whale found himself sliding toward the lhe was so\\r\\nprovoked with the cow that he dived head first, down to the bottom of\\r\\nthe sea. That was a pull! The Elephant was jerked off his feet, came\\r\\nslipping sliding to the beach, into the surf. He was terribly\\r\\nangry. He braced himself with all his might, pulled his best. At the\\r\\njerk, up came the Whale out of the water.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is pulling me?\" spouted the Whale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is pulling me?\" trumpeted the Elephant.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then each saw the rope in the other\\'s hold.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll teach you to play cow!\" roared the Elephant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll show you how to fool me!\" fumed the Whale. And they began to pull\\r\\nagain. But this time the rope broke, the Whale turned a somersault, and\\r\\nthe Elephant fell over backward.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that, they were both so ashamed that neither would speak to the\\r\\nother. So that broke up the bargain between them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd little Brother Rabbit sat in the bushes laughed, laughed,\\r\\nlaughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LITTLE HALF-CHICK\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once upon a time a Spanish Hen, who hatched out some nice\\r\\nlittle chickens. She was much pleased with their looks as they came from\\r\\nthe shell. One, two, three, came out plump fluffy; but when the\\r\\nfourth shell broke, out came a little half-chick! It had only one leg\\r\\none wing one eye! It was just half a chicken.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hen-mother did not know what in the world to do with the queer\\r\\nlittle Half-Chick. She was afraid something would happen to it, she\\r\\ntried hard to protect it keep it from harm. But as soon as it could\\r\\nwalk the little Half-Chick showed a most headstrong spirit, worse than\\r\\nany of its brothers. It would not mind, it would go wherever it\\r\\nwanted to; it walked with a funny little hoppity-kick, hoppity-kick, and\\r\\ngot along pretty fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day the little Half-Chick said, \"Mother, I am off to Madrid, to see\\r\\nthe King! Good-bye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor Hen-mother did everything she could think of to keep him from\\r\\ndoing so foolish a thing, but the little Half-Chick laughed at her\\r\\nnaughtily. \"I\\'m for seeing the King,\" he said; \"this life is too quiet\\r\\nfor me.\" And away he went, hoppity-kick, hoppity-kick, over the fields.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had gone some distance the little Half-Chick came to a little\\r\\nbrook that was caught in the weeds in much trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Little Half-Chick,\" whispered the Water, \"I am so choked with these\\r\\nweeds that I cannot move; I am almost lost, for want of room; please\\r\\npush the sticks weeds away with your bill help me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The idea!\" said the little Half-Chick. \"I cannot be bothered with you;\\r\\nI am off to Madrid, to see the King!\" And in spite of the brook\\'s\\r\\nbegging, he went away, hoppity-kick, hoppity-kick.\\r\\n\\r\\nA bit farther on, the Half-Chick came to a Fire, which was smothered in\\r\\ndamp sticks in great distress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, little Half-Chick,\" said the Fire, \"you are just in time to save\\r\\nme. I am almost dead for want of air. Fan me a little with your wing, I\\r\\nbeg.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The idea!\" said the little Half-Chick. \"I cannot be bothered with you;\\r\\nI am off to Madrid, to see the King!\" And he went laughing off,\\r\\nhoppity-kick, hoppity-kick.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had hoppity-kicked a good way, was near Madrid, he came to a\\r\\nclump of bushes, where the Wind was caught fast. The Wind was\\r\\nwhimpering, begging to be set free.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Little Half-Chick,\" said the Wind, \"you are just in time to help me; if\\r\\nyou will brush aside these twigs leaves, I can get my breath; help\\r\\nme, quickly!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ho! the idea!\" said the little Half-Chick \"I have no time to bother\\r\\nwith you. I am going to Madrid, to see the King.\" And he went off,\\r\\nhoppity-kick, hoppity-kick, leaving the Wind to smother.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a while he came to Madrid to the palace of the King.\\r\\nHoppity-kick, hoppity-kick, the little Half-Chick skipped past the\\r\\nsentry at the gate, hoppity-kick, hoppity-kick, he crossed the\\r\\ncourt. But as he was passing the windows of the kitchen the Cook looked\\r\\nout saw him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The very thing for the King\\'s dinner!\" she said. \"I was needing a\\r\\nchicken!\" And she seized the little Half-Chick by his one wing threw\\r\\nhim into a kettle of water on the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Water came over the little Half-Chick\\'s feathers, over his head,\\r\\ninto his eyes. It was terribly uncomfortable. The little Half-Chick\\r\\ncried out,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Water, don\\'t drown me! Stay down, don\\'t come so high!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" the Water said, \"Little Half-Chick, little Half-Chick, when I was\\r\\nin trouble you would not help me,\" came higher than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the Water grew warm, hot, hotter, frightfully hot; the little\\r\\nHalf-Chick cried out, \"Do not burn so hot, Fire! You are burning me to\\r\\ndeath! Stop!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Fire said, \"Little Half-Chick, little Half-Chick, when I was in\\r\\ntrouble you would not help me,\" burned hotter than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as the little Half-Chick thought he must suffocate, the Cook took\\r\\nthe cover off, to look at the dinner. \"Dear me,\" she said, \"this chicken\\r\\nis no good; it is burned to a cinder.\" And she picked the little\\r\\nHalf-Chick up by one leg threw him out of the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the air he was caught by a breeze taken up higher than the trees.\\r\\nRound round he was twirled till he was so dizzy he thought he must\\r\\nperish. \"Don\\'t blow me so, Wind,\" he cried, \"let me down!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Little Half-Chick, little Half-Chick,\" said the Wind, \"when I was in\\r\\ntrouble you would not help me!\" And the Wind blew him straight up to the\\r\\ntop of the church steeple, stuck him there, fast!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere he stands to this day, with his one eye, his one wing, his one\\r\\nleg. He cannot hoppity-kick any more, but he turns slowly round when the\\r\\nwind blows, keeps his head toward it, to hear what it says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BLACKBERRY-BUSH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA little boy sat at his mother\\'s knees, by the long western window,\\r\\nlooking out into the garden. It was autumn, the wind was sad; and\\r\\nthe golden elm leaves lay scattered about among the grass, on the\\r\\ngravel path. The mother was knitting a little stocking; her fingers\\r\\nmoved the bright needles; but her eyes were fixed on the clear evening\\r\\nsky.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the darkness gathered, the wee boy laid his head on her lap kept\\r\\nso still that, at last, she leaned forward to look into his dear round\\r\\nface. He was not asleep, but was watching very earnestly a\\r\\nblackberry-bush, that waved its one tall, dark-red spray in the wind\\r\\noutside the fence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you thinking about, my darling?\" she said, smoothing his soft,\\r\\nhoney-coloured hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The blackberry-bush, mamma; what does it say? It keeps nodding, nodding\\r\\nto me behind the fence; what does it say, mamma?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It says,\" she answered, \"\\'I see a happy little boy in the warm,\\r\\nfire-lighted room. The wind blows cold, here it is dark lonely;\\r\\nbut that little boy is warm happy safe at his mother\\'s knees. I\\r\\nnod to him, he looks at me. I wonder if he knows how happy he is!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'See, all my leaves are dark crimson. Every day they dry wither\\r\\nmore more; by by they will be so weak they can scarcely cling to\\r\\nmy branches, the north wind will tear them all away, nobody will\\r\\nremember them any more. Then the snow will sink down wrap me close.\\r\\nThen the snow will melt again icy rain will clothe me, the\\r\\nbitter wind will rattle my bare twigs up down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I nod my head to all who pass, dreary nights dreary days go\\r\\nby; but in the happy house, so warm bright, the little boy plays all\\r\\nday with books toys. His mother his father cherish him; he\\r\\nnestles on their knees in the red firelight at night, while they read to\\r\\nhim lovely stories, or sing sweet old songs to him,--the happy little\\r\\nboy! And outside I peep over the snow see a stream of ruddy light\\r\\nfrom a crack in the window-shutter, I nod out here alone in the\\r\\ndark, thinking how beautiful it is.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'And here I wait patiently. I take the snow the rain the cold,\\r\\nI am not sorry, but glad; for in my roots I feel warmth life,\\r\\nI know that a store of greenness beauty is shut up safe in my\\r\\nsmall brown buds. Day night go again again; little by little the\\r\\nsnow melts all away; the ground grows soft; the sky is blue; the little\\r\\nbirds fly over, crying, \"It is spring! it is spring!\" Ah! then through\\r\\nall my twigs I feel the slow sap stirring.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Warmer grow the sunbeams, softer the air. The small blades of\\r\\ngrass creep thick about my feet; the sweet rain helps to swell my\\r\\nshining buds. More more I push forth my leaves, till out I burst in\\r\\na gay green dress, nod in joy pride. The little boy comes\\r\\nrunning to look at me, cries, \"Oh, mamma! the little blackberry-bush\\r\\nis alive beautiful green. Oh, come see!\" And I hear; I\\r\\nbow my head in the summer wind; every day they watch me grow more\\r\\nbeautiful, till at last I shake out blossoms, fair fragrant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'A few days more, I drop the white petals down among the grass,\\r\\nand, lo! there are the green tiny berries! Carefully I hold them up to\\r\\nthe sun; carefully I gather the dew in the summer nights; slowly they\\r\\nripen; they grow larger redder darker, at last they are\\r\\nblack, shining, delicious. I hold them as high as I can for the little\\r\\nboy, who comes dancing out. He shouts with joy, gathers them in his\\r\\ndear hand; he runs to share them with his mother, saying, \"Here is\\r\\nwhat the patient blackberry-bush bore for us: see how nice, mamma!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Ah! then indeed I am glad, would say, if I could, \"Yes, take them,\\r\\ndear little boy; I kept them for you, held them long up to the sun and\\r\\nrain to make them sweet ripe for you\"; I nod nod in full\\r\\ncontent, for my work is done. From the window he watches me thinks,\\r\\n\"There is the little blackberry-bush that was so kind to me. I see it\\r\\nI love it. I know it is safe out there nodding all alone, next\\r\\nsummer it will hold ripe berries up for me to gather again.\"\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the wee boy smiled, said he liked the little story. His mother\\r\\ntook him up in her arms, they went out to supper left the\\r\\nblackberry-bush nodding up down in the wind; there it is\\r\\nnodding yet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FAIRIES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     Up the airy mountain,\\r\\n       Down the rushy glen,\\r\\n     We daren\\'t go a-hunting\\r\\n       For fear of little men.\\r\\n     Wee folk, good folk,\\r\\n       Trooping all together;\\r\\n     Green jacket, red cap,\\r\\n       And white owl\\'s feather!\\r\\n\\r\\n     Down along the rocky shore\\r\\n       Some make their home--\\r\\n     They live on crispy pancakes\\r\\n       Of yellow tide-foam;\\r\\n     Some in the reeds\\r\\n       Of the black mountain-lake,\\r\\n     With frogs for their watch-dogs,\\r\\n       All night awake.\\r\\n\\r\\n     High on the hilltop\\r\\n       The old King sits;\\r\\n     He is now so old gray,\\r\\n       He\\'s nigh lost his wits.\\r\\n     With a bridge of white mist\\r\\n       Columbkill he crosses,\\r\\n     On his stately journeys\\r\\n       From Slieveleague to Rosses;\\r\\n     Or going up with music\\r\\n       On cold starry nights,\\r\\n     To sup with the Queen\\r\\n       Of the gay Northern Lights.\\r\\n\\r\\n     They stole little Bridget\\r\\n       For seven years long;\\r\\n     When she came down again\\r\\n       Her friends were all gone.\\r\\n     They took her lightly back,\\r\\n       Between the night morrow;\\r\\n     They thought that she was fast asleep,\\r\\n       But she was dead with sorrow.\\r\\n     They have kept her ever since\\r\\n       Deep within the lake,\\r\\n     On a bed of flag-leaves,\\r\\n       Watching till she wake.\\r\\n\\r\\n     By the craggy hillside,\\r\\n       Through the mosses bare,\\r\\n     They have planted thorn-trees,\\r\\n       For pleasure here there.\\r\\n     Is any man so daring\\r\\n       As dig them up in spite,\\r\\n     He shall find their sharpest thorns\\r\\n       In his bed at night.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Up the airy mountain,\\r\\n       Down the rushy glen,\\r\\n     We daren\\'t go a-hunting\\r\\n       For fear of little men.\\r\\n     Wee folk, good folk,\\r\\n       Trooping all together;\\r\\n     Green jacket, red cap,\\r\\n       And white owl\\'s feather!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURES OF THE LITTLE FIELD MOUSE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time, there was a little brown Field Mouse; one day he\\r\\nwas out in the fields to see what he could find. He was running along in\\r\\nthe grass, poking his nose into everything looking with his two eyes\\r\\nall about, when he saw a smooth, shiny acorn, lying in the grass. It was\\r\\nsuch a fine shiny little acorn that he thought he would take it home\\r\\nwith him; so he put out his paw to touch it, but the little acorn rolled\\r\\naway from him. He ran after it, but it kept rolling on, just ahead of\\r\\nhim, till it came to a place where a big oak-tree had its roots spread\\r\\nall over the ground. Then it rolled under a big round root.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Mr Field Mouse ran to the root poked his nose under after the\\r\\nacorn, there he saw a small round hole in the ground. He slipped\\r\\nthrough saw some stairs going down into the earth. The acorn was\\r\\nrolling down, with a soft tapping sound, ahead of him, so down he went\\r\\ntoo. Down, down, down, rolled the acorn, down, down, down, went the\\r\\nField Mouse, until suddenly he saw a tiny door at the foot of the\\r\\nstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shiny acorn rolled to the door struck against it with a tap.\\r\\nQuickly the little door opened the acorn rolled inside. The Field\\r\\nMouse hurried as fast as he could down the last stairs, pushed\\r\\nthrough just as the door was closing. It shut behind him, he was in\\r\\na little room. And there, before him, stood a queer little Red Man! He\\r\\nhad a little red cap, a little red jacket, odd little red shoes\\r\\nwith points at the toes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are my prisoner,\" he said to the Field Mouse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What for?\" said the Field Mouse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because you tried to steal my acorn,\" said the little Red Man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is my acorn,\" said the Field Mouse; \"I found it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, it isn\\'t,\" said the little Red Man, \"I have it; you will never see\\r\\nit again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Field Mouse looked all about the room as fast as he could,\\r\\nbut he could not see any acorn. Then he thought he would go back up the\\r\\ntiny stairs to his own home. But the little door was locked, the\\r\\nlittle Red Man had the key. And he said to the poor mouse,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall be my servant; you shall make my bed sweep my room and\\r\\ncook my broth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the little brown Mouse was the little Red Man\\'s servant, every\\r\\nday he made the little Red Man\\'s bed swept the little Red Man\\'s room\\r\\ncooked the little Red Man\\'s broth. And every day the little Red Man\\r\\nwent away through the tiny door, did not come back till afternoon.\\r\\nBut he always locked the door after him, carried away the key.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, one day he was in such a hurry that he turned the key before\\r\\nthe door was quite latched, which, of course, didn\\'t lock it at all. He\\r\\nwent away without noticing,--he was in such a hurry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Field Mouse knew that his chance had come to run away home.\\r\\nBut he didn\\'t want to go without the pretty, shiny acorn. Where it was\\r\\nhe didn\\'t know, so he looked everywhere. He opened every little drawer\\r\\nlooked in, but it wasn\\'t in any of the drawers; he peeped on every\\r\\nshelf, but it wasn\\'t on a shelf; he hunted in every closet, but it\\r\\nwasn\\'t in there. Finally, he climbed up on a chair opened a wee, wee\\r\\ndoor in the chimney-piece,--there it was!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took it quickly in his forepaws, then he took it in his mouth,\\r\\nthen he ran away. He pushed open the little door; he climbed up, up,\\r\\nup the little stairs; he came out through the hole under the root; he\\r\\nran ran through the fields; at last he came to his own house.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he was in his own house he set the shiny acorn on the table. I\\r\\nexpect he set it down hard, for all at once, with a little snap, it\\r\\nopened!--exactly like a little box.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd what do you think! There was a tiny necklace inside! It was a most\\r\\nbeautiful tiny necklace, all made of jewels, it was just big enough\\r\\nfor a lady mouse. So the little Field Mouse gave the tiny necklace to\\r\\nhis little Mouse-sister. She thought it was perfectly lovely. And when\\r\\nshe wasn\\'t wearing it she kept it in the shiny acorn box.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the little Red Man never knew what had become of it, because he\\r\\ndidn\\'t know where the little Field Mouse lived.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nANOTHER LITTLE RED HEN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time there was a little Red Hen, who lived on a farm all by\\r\\nherself. An old Fox, crafty sly, had a den in the rocks, on a hill\\r\\nnear her house. Many many a night this old Fox used to lie awake\\r\\nthink to himself how good that little Red Hen would taste if he\\r\\ncould once get her in his big kettle boil her for dinner. But he\\r\\ncouldn\\'t catch the little Red Hen, because she was too wise for him.\\r\\nEvery time she went out to market she locked the door of the house\\r\\nbehind her, as soon as she came in again she locked the door behind\\r\\nher put the key in her apron pocket, where she kept her scissors and\\r\\nsome sugar candy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the old Fox thought out a way to catch the little Red Hen. Early\\r\\nin the morning he said to his old mother, \"Have the kettle boiling when\\r\\nI come home to-night, for I\\'ll be bringing the little Red Hen for\\r\\nsupper.\" Then he took a big bag slung it over his shoulder, and\\r\\nwalked till he came to the little Red Hen\\'s house. The little Red Hen\\r\\nwas just coming out of her door to pick up a few sticks for firewood. So\\r\\nthe old Fox hid behind the wood-pile, as soon as she bent down to\\r\\nget a stick, into the house he slipped, scurried behind the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a minute the little Red Hen came quickly in, shut the door and\\r\\nlocked it. \"I\\'m glad I\\'m safely in,\" she said. Just as she said it, she\\r\\nturned round, there stood the ugly old Fox, with his big bag over\\r\\nhis shoulder. Whiff! how scared the little Red Hen was! She dropped her\\r\\napronful of sticks, flew up to the big beam across the ceiling.\\r\\nThere she perched, she said to the old Fox, down below, \"You may as\\r\\nwell go home, for you can\\'t get me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t I, though!\" said the Fox. And what do you think he did? He stood\\r\\non the floor underneath the little Red Hen twirled round in a circle\\r\\nafter his own tail. And as he spun, spun, spun, faster, and\\r\\nfaster, faster, the poor little Red Hen got so dizzy watching him\\r\\nthat she couldn\\'t hold on to the perch. She dropped off, the old Fox\\r\\npicked her up put her in his bag, slung the bag over his shoulder,\\r\\nstarted for home, where the kettle was boiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had a very long way to go, up hill, the little Red Hen was still\\r\\nso dizzy that she didn\\'t know where she was. But when the dizziness\\r\\nbegan to go off, she whisked her little scissors out of her apron\\r\\npocket, snip! she cut a little hole in the bag; then she poked her\\r\\nhead out saw where she was, as soon as they came to a good spot\\r\\nshe cut the hole bigger jumped out herself. There was a great big\\r\\nstone lying there, the little Red Hen picked it up put it in the\\r\\nbag as quick as a wink. Then she ran as fast as she could till she came\\r\\nto her own little farmhouse, she went in locked the door with\\r\\nthe big key.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Fox went on carrying the stone never knew the difference.\\r\\nMy, but it bumped him well! He was pretty tired when he got home. But he\\r\\nwas so pleased to think of the supper he was going to have that he did\\r\\nnot mind that at all. As soon as his mother opened the door he said, \"Is\\r\\nthe kettle boiling?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said his mother; \"have you got the little Red Hen?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have,\" said the old Fox. \"When I open the bag you hold the cover off\\r\\nthe kettle I\\'ll shake the bag so that the Hen will fall in, then\\r\\nyou pop the cover on, before she can jump out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right,\" said his mean old mother; she stood close by the\\r\\nboiling kettle, ready to put the cover on.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fox lifted the big, heavy bag up till it was over the open kettle,\\r\\ngave it a shake.

By the time he got home there wasn\\'t anything\\r\\nleft but a fistful of crumbs. His Mammy said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What you got there, Epaminondas?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cake, Mammy,\" said Epaminondas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cake!\" said his Mammy. \"Epaminondas, you ain\\'t got the sense you was\\r\\nborn with! That\\'s no way to carry cake. The way to carry cake is to wrap\\r\\nit all up nice in some leaves put it in your hat, put your hat\\r\\non your head, come along home. You hear me, Epaminondas?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Mammy,\" said Epaminondas.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day Epaminondas went to see his Auntie, she gave him a pound of\\r\\nbutter for his Mammy; fine, fresh, sweet butter.\\r\\n\\r\\nEpaminondas wrapped it up in leaves put it in his hat, put his\\r\\nhat on his head, came along home. It was a very hot day. Pretty soon\\r\\nthe butter began to melt. It melted, melted, as it melted it ran\\r\\ndown Epaminondas\\' forehead; then it ran over his face, in his ears,\\r\\ndown his neck. When he got home, all the butter Epaminondas had was\\r\\n_on him_. His Mammy looked at him, then she said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Law\\'s sake! Epaminondas, what you got in your hat?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Butter, Mammy,\" said Epaminondas; \"Auntie gave it to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Butter!\" said his Mammy. \"Epaminondas, you ain\\'t got the sense you was\\r\\nborn with! Don\\'t you know that\\'s no way to carry butter? The way to\\r\\ncarry butter is to wrap it up in some leaves take it down to the\\r\\nbrook, cool it in the water, cool it in the water, cool it\\r\\nin the water, then take it on your hands, careful, bring it\\r\\nalong home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Mammy,\" said Epaminondas.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy by, another day, Epaminondas went to see his Auntie again, and;\\r\\nthis time she gave him a little new puppy-dog to take home.\\r\\n\\r\\nEpaminondas put it in some leaves took it down to the brook; and\\r\\nthere he cooled it in the water, cooled it in the water, cooled\\r\\nit in the water; then he took it in his hands came along home. When\\r\\nhe got home, the puppy-dog was dead. His Mammy looked at it, she\\r\\nsaid,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Law\\'s sake! Epaminondas, what you got there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A puppy-dog, Mammy,\" said Epaminondas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A _puppy-dog_!\" said his Mammy. \"My gracious sakes alive, Epaminondas,\\r\\nyou ain\\'t got the sense you was born with! That ain\\'t the way to carry a\\r\\npuppy-dog! The way to carry a puppy-dog is to take a long piece of\\r\\nstring tie one end of it round the puppy-dog\\'s neck put the\\r\\npuppy-dog on the ground, take hold of the other end of the string\\r\\ncome along home, like this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All right, Mammy,\" said Epaminondas.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day Epaminondas went to see his Auntie again, when he came to\\r\\ngo home she gave him a loaf of bread to carry to his Mammy; a brown,\\r\\nfresh, crusty loaf of bread.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Epaminondas tied a string around the end of the loaf took hold of\\r\\nthe end of the string came along home, like this. (Imitate dragging\\r\\nsomething along the ground.) When he got home his Mammy looked at the\\r\\nthing on the end of the string, she said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My laws a-massy! Epaminondas, what you got on the end of that string?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bread, Mammy,\" said Epaminondas; \"Auntie gave it to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bread!!!\" said his Mammy. \"O Epaminondas, Epaminondas, you ain\\'t got\\r\\nthe sense you was born with; you never did have the sense you was born\\r\\nwith; you never will have the sense you was born with! Now I ain\\'t gwine\\r\\ntell you any more ways to bring truck home. And don\\'t you go see your\\r\\nAuntie, neither. I\\'ll go see her my own self. But I\\'ll just tell you one\\r\\nthing, Epaminondas! You see these here six mince pies I done make? You\\r\\nsee how I done set \\'em on the doorstep to cool? Well, now, you hear me,\\r\\nEpaminondas, _you be careful how you step on those pies_!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Mammy,\" said Epaminondas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Epaminondas\\' Mammy put on her bonnet her shawl took a\\r\\nbasket in her hwent away to see Auntie. The six mince pies sat\\r\\ncooling in a row on the doorstep.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then,--then,--Epaminondas _was_ careful how he stepped on those\\r\\npies!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stepped (imitate)--right--in--the--middle--of--every--one.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, do you know, children, nobody knows what happened next! The person\\r\\nwho told me the story didn\\'t know; nobody knows. But you can guess.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BOY WHO CRIED \"WOLF!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a shepherd-boy who kept his flock at a little distance\\r\\nfrom the village. Once he thought he would play a trick on the villagers\\r\\nhave some fun at their expense. So he ran toward the village crying\\r\\nout, with all his might,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wolf! Wolf! Come help! The wolves are at my lambs!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kind villagers left their work ran to the field to help him. But\\r\\nwhen they got there the boy laughed at them for their pains; there was\\r\\nno wolf there.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill another day the boy tried the same trick, the villagers came\\r\\nrunning to help got laughed at again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen one day a wolf did break into the fold began killing the lambs.\\r\\nIn great fright, the boy ran for help. \"Wolf! Wolf!\" he screamed. \"There\\r\\nis a wolf in the flock! Help!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe villagers heard him, but they thought it was another mean trick; no\\r\\none paid the least attention, or went near him. And the shepherd-boy\\r\\nlost all his sheep.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is the kind of thing that happens to people who lie: even when they\\r\\ntell the truth no one believes them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FROG KING\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDid you ever hear the old story about the foolish Frogs? The Frogs in a\\r\\ncertain swamp decided that they needed a king; they had always got along\\r\\nperfectly well without one, but they suddenly made up their minds that a\\r\\nking they must have. They sent a messenger to Jove begged him to\\r\\nsend a king to rule over them.\\r\\n\\r\\nJove saw how stupid they were, sent a king who could not harm them:\\r\\nhe tossed a big log into the middle of the pond.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the splash the Frogs were terribly frightened, dived into their\\r\\nholes to hide from King Log. But after a while, when they saw that the\\r\\nking never moved, they got over their fright went sat on him.\\r\\nAnd as soon as they found he really could not hurt them they began to\\r\\ndespise him; finally they sent another messenger to Jove to ask for\\r\\na new king.\\r\\n\\r\\nJove sent an eel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Frogs were much pleased a good deal frightened when King Eel\\r\\ncame wriggling swimming among them. But as the days went on, the\\r\\neel was perfectly harmless, they stopped being afraid; as soon as\\r\\nthey stopped fearing King Eel they stopped respecting him.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon they sent a third messenger to Jove, begged that they might\\r\\nhave a better king,--a king who was worth while.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was too much; Jove was angry at their stupidity at last. \"I will give\\r\\nyou a king such as you deserve!\" he said; he sent them a Stork.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the Frogs came to the surface to greet the new king, King\\r\\nStork caught them in his long bill gobbled them up. One after\\r\\nanother they came bobbing up, one after another the stork ate them.\\r\\nHe was indeed a king worthy of them!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SUN AND THE WIND\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sun the Wind once had a quarrel as to which was the stronger.\\r\\nEach believed himself to be the more powerful. While they were arguing\\r\\nthey saw a traveller walking along the country highway, wearing a great\\r\\ncloak.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is a chance to test our strength,\" said the Wind; \"let us see\\r\\nwhich of us is strong enough to make that traveller take off his cloak;\\r\\nthe one who can do that shall be acknowledged the more powerful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Agreed,\" said the Sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly the Wind began to blow; he puffed tugged at the man\\'s\\r\\ncloak, raised a storm of hail rain, to beat at it. But the\\r\\ncolder it grew the more it stormed, the tighter the traveller held\\r\\nhis cloak around him. The Wind could not get it off.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it was the Sun\\'s turn. He shone with all his beams on the man\\'s\\r\\nshoulders. As it grew hotter hotter, the man unfastened his cloak;\\r\\nthen he threw it back; at last he took it off! The Sun had won.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LITTLE JACKAL AND THE ALLIGATOR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Jackal was very fond of shell-fish. He used to go down by the\\r\\nriver hunt along the edges for crabs such things. And once, when\\r\\nhe was hunting for crabs, he was so hungry that he put his paw into the\\r\\nwater after a crab without looking first,--which you never should do!\\r\\nThe minute he put in his paw, _snap_!--the big Alligator who lives in\\r\\nthe mud down there had it in his jaws.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, dear!\" thought the little Jackal; \"the big Alligator has my paw in\\r\\nhis mouth! In another minute he will pull me down gobble me up! What\\r\\nshall I do? what shall I do?\" Then he thought, suddenly, \"I\\'ll deceive\\r\\nhim!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he put on a very cheerful voice, as if nothing at all were the\\r\\nmatter, he said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ho! ho! Clever Mr Alligator! Smart Mr Alligator, to take that old\\r\\nbulrush root for my paw! I hope you\\'ll find it very tender!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Alligator was hidden away beneath the mud bulrush leaves,\\r\\nhe couldn\\'t see anything. He thought, \"Pshaw! I\\'ve made a mistake.\"\\r\\nSo he opened his mouth let the little Jackal go.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Jackal ran away as fast as he could, as he ran he called\\r\\nout,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, Mr Alligator! Kind Mr Alligator! _So_ kind of you to let me\\r\\ngo!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Alligator lashed with his tail snapped with his jaws, but it\\r\\nwas too late; the little Jackal was out of reach.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this the little Jackal kept away from the river, out of danger.\\r\\nBut after about a week he got such an appetite for crabs that nothing\\r\\nelse would do at all; he felt that he must have a crab. So he went down\\r\\nby the river looked all around, very carefully. He didn\\'t see the\\r\\nold Alligator, but he thought to himself, \"I think I\\'ll not take any\\r\\nchances.\" So he stood still began to talk out loud to himself. He\\r\\nsaid,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I don\\'t see any little crabs on the lI generally see them\\r\\nsticking out of the water, then I put my paw in catch them. I\\r\\nwonder if there are any fat little crabs in the water to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Alligator was hidden down in the mud at the bottom of the river,\\r\\nwhen he heard what the little Jackal said, he thought, \"Aha! I\\'ll\\r\\npretend to be a little crab, when he puts his paw in, I\\'ll make my\\r\\ndinner of him.\" So he stuck the black end of his snout above the water\\r\\nwaited.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Jackal took one look, then he said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, Mr Alligator! Kind Mr Alligator! You are _exceedingly_ kind\\r\\nto show me where you are! I will have dinner elsewhere.\" And he ran away\\r\\nlike the wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Alligator foamed at the mouth, he was so angry, but the little\\r\\nJackal was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor two whole weeks the little Jackal kept away from the river. Then,\\r\\none day he got a feeling inside him that nothing but crabs could\\r\\nsatisfy: he felt that he must have at least one crab. Very cautiously,\\r\\nhe went down to the river looked all around. He saw no sign of the\\r\\nold Alligator. Still, he did not mean to take any chances. So he stood\\r\\nquite still began to talk to himself,--it was a little way he had.\\r\\nHe said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I don\\'t see any little crabs on the shore, or sticking up out of\\r\\nthe water, I usually see them blowing bubbles from under the water; the\\r\\nlittle bubbles go _puff, puff, puff_, then they go _pop, pop, pop_,\\r\\nthey show me where the little juicy crabs are, so I can put my paw\\r\\nin catch them. I wonder if I shall see any little bubbles to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Alligator, lying low in the mud weeds, heard this, he\\r\\nthought, \"Pooh! _That\\'s_ easy enough; I\\'ll just blow some little\\r\\ncrab-bubbles, then he will put his paw in where I can get it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he blew, he blew, a mighty blast, the bubbles rose in a\\r\\nperfect whirlpool, fizzing swirling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Jackal didn\\'t have to be told who was underneath those\\r\\nbubbles: he took one quick look, off he ran. But as he went, he\\r\\nsang,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, Mr Alligator! Kind Mr Alligator! You are the kindest\\r\\nAlligator in the world, to show me where you are, so nicely! I\\'ll\\r\\nbreakfast at another part of the river.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Alligator was so furious that he crawled up on the bank went\\r\\nafter the little Jackal; but, dear, dear, he couldn\\'t catch the little\\r\\nJackal; he ran far too fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this, the little Jackal did not like to risk going near the water,\\r\\nso he ate no more crabs. But he found a garden of wild figs, which were\\r\\nso good that he went there every day, ate them instead of\\r\\nshell-fish.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the old Alligator found this out, he made up his mind to have\\r\\nthe little Jackal for supper, or to die trying. So he crept, and\\r\\ncrawled, dragged himself over the ground to the garden of wild figs.\\r\\nThere he made a huge pile of figs under the biggest of the wild fig\\r\\ntrees, hid himself in the pile.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a while the little Jackal came dancing into the garden, very happy\\r\\nfree from care,--_but_ looking all around. He saw the huge pile of\\r\\nfigs under the big fig tree.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"H-m,\" he thought, \"that looks singularly like my friend, the Alligator.\\r\\nI\\'ll investigate a bit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood quite still began to talk to himself,--it was a little way\\r\\nhe had. He said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The little figs I like best are the fat, ripe, juicy ones that drop off\\r\\nwhen the breeze blows; then the wind blows them about on the ground,\\r\\nthis way that; the great heap of figs over there is so still that I\\r\\nthink they must be all bad figs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Alligator, underneath his fig pile, thought,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bother the suspicious little Jackal! I shall have to make these figs\\r\\nroll about, so that he will think the wind moves them.\" And straight-way\\r\\nhe humped himself up moved, sent the little figs flying,--and\\r\\nhis back showed through.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Jackal did not wait for a second look. He ran out of the\\r\\ngarden like the wind. But as he ran he called back,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, again, Mr Alligator; very sweet of you to show me where you\\r\\nare; I can\\'t stay to thank you as I should like: good-bye!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this the old Alligator was beside himself with rage. He vowed that he\\r\\nwould have the little Jackal for supper this time, come what might. So\\r\\nhe crept crawled over the ground till he came to the little Jackal\\'s\\r\\nhouse. Then he crept crawled inside, hid himself there in the\\r\\nhouse, to wait till the little Jackal should come home.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy by the little Jackal came dancing home, happy free from\\r\\ncare,--_but_ looking all around. Presently, as he came along, he saw\\r\\nthat the ground was all raked up as if something very heavy had been\\r\\ndragged over it. The little Jackal stopped looked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s this? what\\'s this?\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he saw that the door of his house was crushed at the sides and\\r\\nbroken, as if something very big had gone through it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s this? What\\'s this?\" the little Jackal said. \"I think I\\'ll\\r\\ninvestigate a little!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he stood quite still began to talk to himself (you remember, it\\r\\nwas a little way he had), but loudly. He said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How strange that my little House doesn\\'t speak to me! Why don\\'t you\\r\\nspeak to me, little House? You always speak to me, if everything is all\\r\\nright, when I come home. I wonder if anything is wrong with my little\\r\\nHouse?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Alligator thought to himself that he must certainly pretend to\\r\\nbe the little House, or the little Jackal would never come in. So he put\\r\\non as pleasant a voice as he could (which is not saying much) and\\r\\nsaid,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hullo, little Jackal!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! When the little Jackal heard that, he was frightened enough, for\\r\\nonce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s the old Alligator,\" he said, \"if I don\\'t make an end of him\\r\\nthis time he will certainly make an end of me. What shall I do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe thought very fast. Then he spoke out pleasantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, little House,\" he said, \"it\\'s good to hear your pretty\\r\\nvoice, dear little House, I will be in with you in a minute; only\\r\\nfirst I must gather some firewood for dinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he went gathered firewood, more firewood, more\\r\\nfirewood; he piled it all up solid against the door round the\\r\\nhouse; then he set fire to it!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it smoked burned till it smoked that old Alligator to smoked\\r\\nherring!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LARKS IN THE CORNFIELD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a family of little Larks who lived with their mother in a\\r\\nnest in a cornfield. When the corn was ripe the mother Lark watched very\\r\\ncarefully to see if there were any sign of the reapers\\' coming, for she\\r\\nknew that when they came their sharp knives would cut down the nest and\\r\\nhurt the baby Larks. So every day, when she went out for food, she told\\r\\nthe little Larks to look listen very closely to everything that\\r\\nwent on, to tell her all they saw heard when she came home.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day when she came home the little Larks were much frightened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Mother, dear Mother,\" they said, \"you must move us away to-night!\\r\\nThe farmer was in the field to-day, he said, \\'The corn is ready to\\r\\ncut; we must call in the neighbours to help.\\' And then he told his son\\r\\nto go out to-night ask all the neighbours to come reap the corn\\r\\nto-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mother Lark laughed. \"Don\\'t be frightened,\" she said; \"if he waits\\r\\nfor his neighbours to reap the corn we shall have plenty of time to\\r\\nmove; tell me what he says to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next night the little Larks were quite trembling with fear; the\\r\\nmoment their mother got home they cried out, \"Mother, you must surely\\r\\nmove us to-night! The farmer came to-day said, \\'The corn is getting\\r\\ntoo ripe; we cannot wait for our neighbours; we must ask our relatives\\r\\nto help us.\\' And then he called his son told him to ask all the\\r\\nuncles cousins to come to-morrow cut the corn. Shall we not move\\r\\nto-night?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t worry,\" said the mother Lark; \"the uncles cousins have plenty\\r\\nof reaping to do for themselves; we\\'ll not move yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third night, when the mother Lark came home, the baby Larks said,\\r\\n\"Mother, dear, the farmer came to the field to-day, when he looked\\r\\nat the corn he was quite angry; he said, \\'This will never do! The corn\\r\\nis getting too ripe; it\\'s no use to wait for our relatives, we shall\\r\\nhave to cut this corn ourselves.\\' And then he called his son said,\\r\\n\\'Go out to-night hire reapers, to-morrow we will begin to cut.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said the mother, \"that is another story; when a man begins to do\\r\\nhis own business, instead of asking somebody else to do it, things get\\r\\ndone. I will move you out to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA TRUE STORY ABOUT A GIRL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce there were four little girls who lived in a big, bare house, in the\\r\\ncountry. They were very poor, but they had the happiest times you ever\\r\\nheard of, because they were very rich in everything except money. They\\r\\nhad a wonderful, wise father, who knew stories to tell, who taught\\r\\nthem their lessons in such a beautiful way that it was better than play;\\r\\nthey had a lovely, merry, kind mother, who was never too tired to help\\r\\nthem work or watch them play; they had all the great green country\\r\\nto play in. There were dark, shadowy woods, fields of flowers, a\\r\\nriver. And there was a big barn.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the little girls was named Louisa. She was very pretty, ever\\r\\nso strong; she could run for miles through the woods not get tired.\\r\\nShe had a splendid brain in her little head; it liked study, it\\r\\nthought interesting thoughts all day long.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa liked to sit in a corner by herself, sometimes, write\\r\\nthoughts in her diary; all the little girls kept diaries. She liked to\\r\\nmake up stories out of her own head, sometimes she made verses.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the four little sisters had finished their lessons, had helped\\r\\ntheir mother wash up sew, they used to go to the big barn to play;\\r\\nthe best play of all was theatricals. Louisa liked theatricals\\r\\nbetter than anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey made the barn into a theatre, the grown-up people came to see\\r\\nthe plays they acted. They used to climb up on the hay-loft for a stage,\\r\\nthe grown people sat in chairs on the floor. It was great fun. One\\r\\nof the plays they acted was _Jack the Beanstalk_. They had a ladder\\r\\nfrom the floor to the loft, on the ladder they tied a vine all the\\r\\nway up to the loft, to look like the wonderful beanstalk. One of the\\r\\nlittle girls was dressed up to look like Jack, she acted that part.\\r\\nWhen it came to the place in the story where the giant tried to follow\\r\\nJack, the little girl cut down the beanstalk, down came the giant\\r\\ntumbling from the loft. The giant was made out of pillows, with a great,\\r\\nfierce head of paper, funny clothes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother story that they acted was _Cinderella_. They made a wonderful\\r\\nbig pumpkin out of the wheelbarrow, trimmed with yellow paper, and\\r\\nCinderella rolled away in it, when the fairy godmother waved her wand.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne other beautiful story they used to play. It was the story of\\r\\n_Pilgrim\\'s Progress_; if you have never heard it, you must be sure to\\r\\nread it as soon as you can read well enough to understthe\\r\\nold-fashioned words. The little girls used to put shells in their hats\\r\\nfor a sign they were on a pilgrimage, as the old pilgrims used to do;\\r\\nthen they made journeys over the hill behind the house, through the\\r\\nwoods, down the lanes; when the pilgrimage was over they had\\r\\napples nuts to eat, in the happy lof home.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa loved all these plays, she made some of her own wrote\\r\\nthem down so that the children could act them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut better than fun or writing Louisa loved her mother, by by,\\r\\nas the little girl began to grow into a big girl, she felt very sad to\\r\\nsee her dear mother work so hard. She helped all she could with the\\r\\nhousework, but nothing could really help the tired mother except money;\\r\\nshe needed money for food clothes, someone grown up, to help in\\r\\nthe house. But there never was enough money for these things, and\\r\\nLouisa\\'s mother grew more more weary, sometimes ill. I cannot\\r\\ntell you how much Louisa suffered over this.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, as Louisa thought about it, she came to care more about helping\\r\\nher mother her father her sisters than about anything else in\\r\\nall the world. And she began to work very hard to earn money. She sewed\\r\\nfor people, when she was a little older she taught some little girls\\r\\ntheir lessons, then she wrote stories for the papers. Every bit of\\r\\nmoney she earned, except what she had to use, she gave to her dear\\r\\nfamily. It helped very much, but it was so little that Louisa never felt\\r\\nas if she were doing anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery year she grew more unselfish, every year she worked harder.\\r\\nShe liked writing stories best of all her work, but she did not get much\\r\\nmoney for them, some people told her she was wasting her time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, one day, a publisher asked Louisa, who was now a woman, to\\r\\nwrite a book for girls. Louisa was not very well, she was very\\r\\ntired, but she always said, \"I\\'ll try,\" when she had a chance to work;\\r\\nso she said, \"I\\'ll try,\" to the publisher. When she thought about the\\r\\nbook she remembered the good times she used to have with her sisters in\\r\\nthe big, bare house in the country. And so she wrote a story put all\\r\\nthat in it; she put her dear mother her wise father in it, all\\r\\nthe little sisters, besides the jolly times the plays, she put\\r\\nthe sad, hard times in,--the work worry going without things.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the book was written, she called it _Little Women_, sent it to\\r\\nthe publisher.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, children, the little book made Louisa famous. It was so sweet and\\r\\nfunny sad real,--like our own lives,--that everybody wanted to\\r\\nread it. Everybody bought it, much money came from it. After so many\\r\\nyears, little Louisa\\'s wish came true: she bought a nice house for her\\r\\nfamily; she sent one of her sisters to Europe, to study; she gave her\\r\\nfather books; but best of all, she was able to see to it that the\\r\\nbeloved mother, so tired so ill, could have rest happiness.\\r\\nNever again did the dear mother have to do any hard work, she had\\r\\npretty things about her all the rest of her life.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa Alcott, for that was Louisa\\'s name, wrote many beautiful books\\r\\nafter this, she became one of the most famous women of America. But\\r\\nI think the most beautiful thing about her is what I have been telling\\r\\nyou: that she loved her mother so well that she gave her whole life to\\r\\nmake her happy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMY KINGDOM\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Louisa I told you about, who wrote verses stories in her\\r\\ndiary, used to like to play that she was a princess, that her\\r\\nkingdom was her own mind. When she had unkind or dissatisfied thoughts,\\r\\nshe tried to get rid of them by playing they were enemies of the\\r\\nkingdom; she drove them out with soldiers; the soldiers were\\r\\npatience, duty, love. It used to help Louisa to be good to play\\r\\nthis, I think it may have helped make her the splendid woman she was\\r\\nafterward. Maybe you would like to hear a poem she wrote about it, when\\r\\nshe was only fourteen years old. It will help you, too, to think the\\r\\nsame thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\n     A little kingdom I possess,\\r\\n       Where thoughts feelings dwell,\\r\\n     And very hard I find the task\\r\\n       Of governing it well;\\r\\n     For passion tempts troubles me,\\r\\n       A wayward will misleads,\\r\\n     And selfishness its shadow casts\\r\\n       On all my words deeds.\\r\\n\\r\\n     How can I learn to rule myself,\\r\\n       To be the child I should,\\r\\n     Honest brave, nor ever tire\\r\\n       Of trying to be good?\\r\\n     How can I keep a sunny soul\\r\\n       To shine along life\\'s way?\\r\\n     How can I tune my little heart\\r\\n       To sweetly sing all day?\\r\\n\\r\\n     Dear Father, help me with the love\\r\\n       That casteth out my fear,\\r\\n     Teach me to lean on Thee, feel\\r\\n       That Thou art very near,\\r\\n     That no temptation is unseen,\\r\\n       No childish grief too small,\\r\\n     Since Thou, with patience infinite,\\r\\n       Doth soothe comfort all.\\r\\n\\r\\n     I do not ask for any crown\\r\\n       But that which all may win,\\r\\n     Nor seek to conquer any world,\\r\\n       Except the one within.\\r\\n     Be Thou my Guide until I find,\\r\\n       Led by a tender hand,\\r\\n     Thy happy kingdom in _myself_,\\r\\n       And dare to take command.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPICCOLA\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     Poor, sweet Piccola! Did you hear\\r\\n     What happened to Piccola, children dear?\\r\\n     \\'Tis seldom Fortune such favour grants\\r\\n     As fell to this little maid of France.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \\'Twas Christmas-time, her parents poor\\r\\n     Could hardly drive the wolf from the door,\\r\\n     Striving with poverty\\'s patient pain\\r\\n     Only to live till summer again.\\r\\n\\r\\n     No gifts for Piccola! Sad were they\\r\\n     When dawned the morning of Christmas-day;\\r\\n     Their little darling no joy might stir,\\r\\n     St Nicholas nothing would bring to her!\\r\\n\\r\\n     But Piccola never doubted at all\\r\\n     That something beautiful must befall\\r\\n     Every child upon Christmas-day,\\r\\n     And so she slept till the dawn was gray.\\r\\n\\r\\n     And full of faith, when at last she woke,\\r\\n     She stole to her shoe as the morning broke;\\r\\n     Such sounds of gladness filled all the air,\\r\\n     Twas plain St Nicholas had been there!\\r\\n\\r\\n     In rushed Piccola sweet, half wild:\\r\\n     Never was seen such a joyful child.\\r\\n     \"See what the good saint brought!\" she cried,\\r\\n     And mother father must peep inside.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Now such a story who ever heard?\\r\\n     There was a little shivering bird!\\r\\n     A sparrow, that in at the window flew,\\r\\n     Had crept into Piccola\\'s tiny shoe!\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"How good poor Piccola must have been!\"\\r\\n     She cried, as happy as any queen,\\r\\n     While the starving sparrow she fed warmed,\\r\\n     And danced with rapture, she was so charmed.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Children, this story I tell to you,\\r\\n     Of Piccola sweet her bird, is true.\\r\\n     In the far-off lof France, they say,\\r\\n     Still do they live to this very day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LITTLE FIR TREE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was a very little girl some one, probably my mother, read to me\\r\\nHans Christian Andersen\\'s story of the Little Fir Tree. It happened that\\r\\nI did not read it for myself or hear it again during my childhood. One\\r\\nChristmas Day, when I was grown up, I found myself at a loss for the\\r\\n\"one more\" story called for by some little children with whom I was\\r\\nspending the holiday. In the mental search for buried treasure which\\r\\nensued, I came upon one or two word-impressions of the experiences of\\r\\nthe Little Fir Tree, forthwith wove them into what I supposed to be\\r\\nsomething of a reproduction of the original. The latter part of the\\r\\nstory had wholly faded from my memory, so that I \"made up\" to suit the\\r\\ntastes of my audience. Afterward I told the story to a good many\\r\\nchildren, at one time or another, it gradually took the shape it has\\r\\nhere. It was not until several years later that, in rereading Andersen\\r\\nfor other purposes, I came upon the real story of the Little Fir Tree,\\r\\nread it for myself. Then indeed I was amused, somewhat\\r\\ndistressed, to find how far I had wandered from the text.\\r\\n\\r\\nI give this explanation that the reader may know I do not presume to\\r\\noffer the little tale which follows as an \"adaptation\" of Andersen\\'s\\r\\nfamous story. I offer it plainly as a story which children have liked,\\r\\nwhich grew out of my early memories of Andersen\\'s _The Little Fir\\r\\nTree_.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce there was a Little Fir Tree, slim pointed, shiny, which\\r\\nstood in the great forest in the midst of some big fir trees, broad, and\\r\\ntall, shadowy green. The Little Fir Tree was very unhappy because he\\r\\nwas not big like the others. When the birds came flying into the woods\\r\\nlit on the branches of the big trees built their nests there, he\\r\\nused to call up to them,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come down, come down, rest in my branches!\" But they always said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no, no; you are too little!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the splendid wind came blowing singing through the forest, it\\r\\nbent rocked swung the tops of the big trees, murmured to\\r\\nthem. Then the Little Fir Tree looked up, called,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, please, dear wind, come down play with me!\" But he always\\r\\nsaid,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no; you are too little, you are too little!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the winter the white snow fell softly, softly, covered the great\\r\\ntrees all over with wonderful caps coats of white. The Little Fir\\r\\nTree, close down in the cover of the others, would call up,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, please, dear snow, give me a cap, too! I want to play, too!\" But\\r\\nthe snow always said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh no, no, no; you are too little, you are too little!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worst of all was when men came into the wood, with sledges teams\\r\\nof horses. They came to cut the big trees down carry them away.\\r\\nWhenever one had been cut down carried away the others talked about\\r\\nit, nodded their heads, the Little Fir Tree listened, heard\\r\\nthem say that when you were carried away so, you might become the mast\\r\\nof a mighty ship, go far away over the ocean, see many wonderful\\r\\nthings; or you might be part of a fine house in a great city, see\\r\\nmuch of life. The Little Fir Tree wanted greatly to see life, but he\\r\\nwas always too little; the men passed him by.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut by by, one cold winter\\'s morning, men came with a sledge and\\r\\nhorses, after they had cut here there they came to the circle of\\r\\ntrees round the Little Fir Tree, looked all about.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are none little enough,\" they said.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! how the Little Fir Tree pricked up his needles!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is one,\" said one of the men, \"it is just little enough.\" And he\\r\\ntouched the Little Fir Tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Little Fir Tree was happy as a bird, because he knew they were about\\r\\nto cut him down. And when he was being carried away on the sledge he lay\\r\\nwondering, _so_ contentedly, whether he should be the mast of a ship or\\r\\npart of a fine city house. But when they came to the town he was taken\\r\\nout set upright in a tub placed on the edge of a path in a row\\r\\nof other fir trees, all small, but none so little as he. And then the\\r\\nLittle Fir Tree began to see life.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople kept coming to look at the trees to take them away. But\\r\\nalways when they saw the Little Fir Tree they shook their heads and\\r\\nsaid,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is too little, too little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil, finally, two children came along, hin hand, looking\\r\\ncarefully at all the small trees. When they saw the Little Fir Tree they\\r\\ncried out,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ll take this one; it is just little enough!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey took him out of his tub carried him away, between them. And the\\r\\nhappy Little Fir Tree spent all his time wondering what it could be that\\r\\nhe was just little enough for; he knew it could hardly be a mast or a\\r\\nhouse, since he was going away with children.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe kept wondering, while they took him in through some big doors, and\\r\\nset him up in another tub, on the table, in a bare little room. Very\\r\\nsoon they went away, came back again with a big basket, which they\\r\\ncarried between them. Then some pretty ladies, with white caps on their\\r\\nheads white aprons over their blue dresses, came bringing little\\r\\nparcels. The children took things out of the basket began to play\\r\\nwith the Little Fir Tree, just as he had often begged the wind the\\r\\nsnow the birds to do. He felt their soft little touches on his head\\r\\nhis twigs his branches. When he looked down at himself, as far\\r\\nas he could look, he saw that he was all hung with gold silver\\r\\nchains! There were strings of white fluffy stuff drooping around him;\\r\\nhis twigs held little gold nuts pink, rosy balls silver stars;\\r\\nhe had pretty little pink white candles in his arms; but last, and\\r\\nmost wonderful of all, the children hung a beautiful white, floating\\r\\ndoll-angel over his head! The Little Fir Tree could not breathe, for joy\\r\\nwonder. What was it that he was, now? Why was this glory for him?\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a time every one went away left him. It grew dusk, the\\r\\nLittle Fir Tree began to hear strange sounds through the closed doors.\\r\\nSometimes he heard a child crying. He was beginning to be lonely. It\\r\\ngrew more more shadowy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll at once, the doors opened the two children came in. Two of the\\r\\npretty ladies were with them. They came up to the Little Fir Tree and\\r\\nquickly lighted all the little pink white candles. Then the two\\r\\npretty ladies took hold of the table with the Little Fir Tree on it and\\r\\npushed it, very smoothly quickly, out of the doors, across a hall,\\r\\nin at another door.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Little Fir Tree had a sudden sight of a long room with many little\\r\\nwhite beds in it, of children propped up on pillows in the beds, of\\r\\nother children in great wheeled chairs, others hobbling about or\\r\\nsitting in little chairs. He wondered why all the little children looked\\r\\nso white tired; he did not know that he was in a hospital. But\\r\\nbefore he could wonder any more his breath was quite taken away by the\\r\\nshout those little white children gave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! oh! m-m! m-m!\" they cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How pretty! How beautiful! Oh, isn\\'t it lovely!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew they must mean him, for all their shining eyes were looking\\r\\nstraight at him. He stood as straight as a mast, quivered in every\\r\\nneedle, for joy. Presently one little weak child-voice called out,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s the nicest Christmas tree I ever saw!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then, at last, the Little Fir Tree knew what he was; he was a\\r\\nChristmas tree! And from his shiny head to his feet he was glad, through\\r\\nthrough, because he was just little enough to be the nicest kind of\\r\\ntree in the world!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW MOSES WAS SAVED\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThousands of years ago, many years before David lived, there was a very\\r\\nwise good man of his people who was a friend adviser of the king\\r\\nof Egypt. And for love of this friend, the king of Egypt had let numbers\\r\\nof the Israelites settle in his land. But after the king his\\r\\nIsraelitish friend were dead, there was a new king, who hated the\\r\\nIsraelites. When he saw how strong they were, how many there were of\\r\\nthem, he began to be afraid that some day they might number more than\\r\\nthe Egyptians, might take his lfrom him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he his rulers did a wicked thing. They made the Israelites\\r\\nslaves. And they gave them terrible tasks to do, without proper rest, or\\r\\nfood, or clothes. For they hoped that the hardship would kill off the\\r\\nIsraelites. They thought the old men would die the young men be so\\r\\nill weary that they could not bring up families, so the race\\r\\nwould dwindle away.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in spite of the work suffering, the Israelites remained strong,\\r\\nmore more boys grew up, to make the king afraid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he did the most wicked thing of all. He ordered his soldiers to\\r\\nkill every boy baby that should be born in an Israelitish family; he did\\r\\nnot care about the girls, because they could not grow up to fight.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery soon after this wicked order, a boy baby was born in a certain\\r\\nIsraelitish family. When his mother first looked at him her heart was\\r\\nnearly broken, for he was even more beautiful than most babies are,--so\\r\\nstrong fair sweet. But he was a boy! How could she save him from\\r\\ndeath?\\r\\n\\r\\nSomehow, she contrived to keep him hidden for three whole months. But at\\r\\nthe end of that time, she saw that it would not be possible to keep him\\r\\nsafe any longer. She had been thinking all this time about what she\\r\\nshould do, now she carried out her plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, she took a basket made of bulrushes daubed it all over with\\r\\npitch, so that it was water-tight, then she laid the baby in it;\\r\\nthen she carried it to the edge of the river laid it in the flags by\\r\\nthe river\\'s brink. It did not show at all, unless one were quite near\\r\\nit. Then she kissed her little son left him there. But his sister\\r\\nstood far off, not seeming to watch, but really watching carefully to\\r\\nsee what would happen to the baby.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon there was the sound of talk laughter, a train of beautiful\\r\\nwomen came down to the water\\'s edge. It was the king\\'s daughter, come\\r\\ndown to bathe in the river, with her maidens. The maidens walked along\\r\\nby the river side.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the king\\'s daughter came near to the water, she saw the strange\\r\\nlittle basket lying in the flags, she sent her maid to bring it to\\r\\nher. And when she had opened it, she saw the child; the poor baby was\\r\\ncrying. When she saw him, so helpless so beautiful, crying for his\\r\\nmother, the king\\'s daughter pitied him loved him. She knew the cruel\\r\\norder of her father, she said at once, \"This is one of the Hebrews\\'\\r\\nchildren.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment the baby\\'s sister came to the princess said, \"Shall I\\r\\ngo find thee a nurse from the Hebrew women, so that she may nurse\\r\\nthe child for thee?\" Not a word did she say about whose child it was,\\r\\nbut perhaps the princess guessed; I don\\'t know. At all events, she told\\r\\nthe little girl to go.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the maiden went, brought her mother!\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the king\\'s daughter said to the baby\\'s mother, \"Take this child\\r\\naway nurse it for me, I will give thee wages.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWas not that a strange thing? And can you think how happy the baby\\'s\\r\\nmother was? For now the baby would be known only as the princess\\'s\\r\\nadopted child, would be safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it was so. The mother kept him until he was old enough to be taken\\r\\nto the princess\\'s palace. Then he was brought given to the king\\'s\\r\\ndaughter, he became her son. And she named him Moses.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the strangest part of the whole story is, that when Moses grew to be\\r\\na man he became so strong wise that it was he who at last saved his\\r\\npeople from the king rescued them from the Egyptians. The one child\\r\\nsaved by the king\\'s own daughter was the very one the king would most\\r\\nhave wanted to kill, if he had known.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TEN FAIRIES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time there was a dear little girl, whose name was Elsa.\\r\\nElsa\\'s father mother worked very hard became rich. But they\\r\\nloved Elsa so much that they did not like her to do any work; very\\r\\nfoolishly, they let her play all the time. So when Elsa grew up, she did\\r\\nnot know how to do anything; she could not make bread, she could not\\r\\nsweep a room, she could not sew a seam; she could only laugh sing.\\r\\nBut she was so sweet merry that everybody loved her. And by by,\\r\\nshe married one of the people who loved her, had a house of her own\\r\\nto take care of.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, then, my dears, came hard times for Elsa! There were so many\\r\\nthings to be done in the house, she did not know how to do any of\\r\\nthem! And because she had never worked at all it made her very tired\\r\\neven to try; she was tired before the morning was over, every day. The\\r\\nmaid would come say, \"How shall I do this?\" or \"How shall I do\\r\\nthat?\" Elsa would have to say, \"I don\\'t know.\" Then the maid would\\r\\npretend that she did not know, either; when she saw her mistress\\r\\nsitting about doing nothing, she, too, sat about, idle.\\r\\n\\r\\nElsa\\'s husbhad a hard time of it; he had only poor food to eat, and\\r\\nit was not ready at the right time, the house looked all in a\\r\\nmuddle. It made him sad, that made Elsa sad, for she wanted to do\\r\\neverything just right.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, one day, Elsa\\'s husbwent away quite cross; he said to her,\\r\\nas he went out of the door, \"It is no wonder that the house looks so,\\r\\nwhen you sit all day with your hands in your lap!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Elsa cried bitterly when he was gone, for she did not want to\\r\\nmake her husbunhappy cross, she wanted the house to look\\r\\nnice. \"Oh, dear,\" she sobbed, \"I wish I could do things right! I wish I\\r\\ncould work! I wish--I wish I had ten good fairies to work for me! Then I\\r\\ncould keep the house!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she said the words, a great grey man stood before her; he was wrapped\\r\\nin a strange grey cloak that covered him from head to foot; he\\r\\nsmiled at Elsa. \"What is the matter, dear?\" he said. \"Why do you cry?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I am crying because I do not know how to keep the house,\" said\\r\\nElsa. \"I cannot make bread, I cannot sweep, I cannot sew a seam; when I\\r\\nwas a little girl I never learned to work, now I cannot do anything\\r\\nright. I wish I had ten good fairies to help me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall have them, dear,\" said the grey man, he shook his strange\\r\\ngrey cloak. Pouf! Out hopped ten tiny fairies, no bigger than that!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These shall be your servants, Elsa,\" said the grey man; \"they are\\r\\nfaithful clever, they will do everything you want them to, just\\r\\nright. But the neighbours might stare ask questions if they saw\\r\\nthese little chaps running about your house, so I will hide them away\\r\\nfor you. Give me your little useless hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWondering, Elsa stretched out her pretty, little, white hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now stretch out your little useless fingers, dear!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElsa stretched out her pretty pink fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grey man touched each one of the ten little fingers, as he\\r\\ntouched them he said their names: \"Little Thumb; Forefinger;\\r\\nThimble-finger; Ring-finger; Little Finger; Little Thumb; Forefinger;\\r\\nThimble-finger; Ring-finger; Little Finger!\" And as he named the\\r\\nfingers, one after another, the tiny fairies bowed their tiny heads;\\r\\nthere was a fairy for every name.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hop! hide yourselves away!\" said the grey man.\\r\\n\\r\\nHop, hop! The fairies sprang to Elsa\\'s knee, then to the palms of her\\r\\nhands, then--whisk! they were all hidden away in her little pink\\r\\nfingers, a fairy in every finger! And the grey man was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nElsa sat looked with wonder at her little white hands the ten\\r\\nuseless fingers. But suddenly the little fingers began to stir. The tiny\\r\\nfairies who were hidden away there were not used to remaining still, and\\r\\nthey were getting restless. They stirred so that Elsa jumped up ran\\r\\nto the cooking table, took hold of the bread board. No sooner had\\r\\nshe touched the bread board than the little fairies began to work: they\\r\\nmeasured the flour, mixed the bread, kneaded the loaves, set them to\\r\\nrise, quicker than you could wink; when the bread was done, it was\\r\\nas nice as you could wish. Then the little fairy-fingers seized the\\r\\nbroom, in a twinkling they were making the house clean. And so it\\r\\nwent, all day. Elsa flew about from one thing to another, the ten\\r\\nfairies did the work, just right.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the maid saw her mistress working, she began to work, too; when\\r\\nshe saw how beautifully everything was done, she was ashamed to do\\r\\nanything badly herself. In a little while the housework was going\\r\\nsmoothly, Elsa could laugh sing again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no more crossness in that house. Elsa\\'s husbgrew so proud\\r\\nof her that he went about saying to everybody, \"My grandmother was a\\r\\nfine housekeeper, my mother was a fine housekeeper, but neither of\\r\\nthem could hold a candle to my wife. She has only one maid, but, to see\\r\\nthe work done, you would think she had as many servants as she has\\r\\nfingers on her hands!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Elsa heard that, she used to laugh, but she never, never told.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time there was an honest shoemaker, who was very poor. He\\r\\nworked as hard as he could, still he could not earn enough to keep\\r\\nhimself his wife. At last there came a day when he had nothing left\\r\\nbut one piece of leather, big enough to make one pair of shoes. He cut\\r\\nout the shoes, ready to stitch, left them on the bench; then he said\\r\\nhis prayers went to bed, trusting that he could finish the shoes on\\r\\nthe next day sell them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBright early the next morning, he rose went to his work bench.\\r\\nThere lay a pair of shoes, beautifully made, the leather was gone!\\r\\nThere was no sign of anyone having been there. The shoemaker his\\r\\nwife did not know what to make of it. But the first customer who came\\r\\nwas so pleased with the beautiful shoes that he bought them, paid so\\r\\nmuch that the shoemaker was able to buy leather enough for two pairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nHappily, he cut them out, then, as it was late, he left the pieces\\r\\non the bench, ready to sew in the morning. But when morning came, two\\r\\npairs of shoes lay on the bench, most beautifully made, no sign of\\r\\nanyone who had been there. The shoemaker his wife were quite at a\\r\\nloss.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat day a customer came bought both pairs, paid so much for\\r\\nthem that the shoemaker bought leather for four pairs, with the money.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more he cut out the shoes left them on the bench. And in the\\r\\nmorning all four pairs were made.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt went on like this until the shoemaker his wife were prosperous\\r\\npeople. But they could not be satisfied to have so much done for them\\r\\nnot know to whom they should be grateful. So one night, after the\\r\\nshoemaker had left the pieces of leather on the bench, he his wife\\r\\nhid themselves behind a curtain, left a light in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as the clock struck twelve the door opened softly, two tiny\\r\\nelves came dancing into the room, hopped on to the bench, began to\\r\\nput the pieces together. They were quite naked, but they had wee little\\r\\nscissors hammers thread. Tap! tap! went the little hammers;\\r\\nstitch, stitch, went the thread, the little elves were hard at work.\\r\\nNo one ever worked so fast as they. In almost no time all the shoes were\\r\\nstitched finished. Then the tiny elves took hold of each other\\'s\\r\\nhands danced round the shoes on the bench, till the shoemaker and\\r\\nhis wife had hard work not to laugh aloud. But as the clock struck two,\\r\\nthe little creatures whisked away out of the window, left the room\\r\\nall as it was before.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shoemaker his wife looked at each other, said, \"How can we\\r\\nthank the little elves who have made us happy prosperous?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like to make them some pretty clothes,\" said the wife, \"they\\r\\nare quite naked.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will make the shoes if you will make the coats,\" said her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat very day they commenced their task. The wife cut out two tiny, tiny\\r\\ncoats of green, two weeny, weeny waistcoats of yellow, two little pairs\\r\\nof trousers, of white, two bits of caps, bright red (for every one knows\\r\\nthe elves love bright colours), her husbmade two little pairs of\\r\\nshoes with long, pointed toes. They made the wee clothes as dainty as\\r\\ncould be, with nice little stitches pretty buttons; by Christmas\\r\\ntime, they were finished.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Christmas eve, the shoemaker cleaned his bench, on it, instead of\\r\\nleather, he laid the two sets of gay little fairy-clothes. Then he and\\r\\nhis wife hid away as before, to watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nPromptly at midnight, the little naked elves came in. They hopped upon\\r\\nthe bench; but when they saw the little clothes there, they laughed and\\r\\ndanced for joy. Each one caught up his little coat things began\\r\\nto put them on. Then they looked at each other made all kinds of\\r\\nfunny motions in their delight. At last they began to dance, when\\r\\nthe clock struck two, they danced quite away, out of the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey never came back any more, but from that day they gave the shoemaker\\r\\nhis wife good luck, so that they never needed any more help.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWHO KILLED THE OTTER\\'S BABIES?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the Otter came to the Mouse-deer said, \"Friend Mouse-deer, will\\r\\nyou please take care of my babies while I go to the river, to catch\\r\\nfish?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" said the Mouse-deer, \"go along.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the Otter came back from the river, with a string of fish, he\\r\\nfound his babies crushed flat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does this mean, Friend Mouse-deer?\" he said. \"Who killed my\\r\\nchildren while you were taking care of them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very sorry,\" said the Mouse-deer, \"but you know I am Chief Dancer\\r\\nof the War-dance, the Woodpecker came sounded the war-gong, so I\\r\\ndanced. I forgot your children, trod on them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall go to King Solomon,\" said the Otter, \"you shall be\\r\\npunished.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon the Mouse-deer was called before King Solomon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you kill the Otter\\'s babies?\" said the king.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, your Majesty,\" said the Mouse-deer, \"but I did not mean to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How did it happen?\" said the king.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your Majesty knows,\" said the Mouse-deer, \"that I am Chief Dancer of\\r\\nthe War-dance. The Woodpecker came sounded the war-gong, I had\\r\\nto dance; as I danced I trod on the Otter\\'s children.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Send for the Woodpecker,\" said King Solomon. When the Woodpecker came,\\r\\nhe said to him, \"Was it you who sounded the war-gong?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, your Majesty,\" said the Woodpecker, \"but I had to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why?\" said the king.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your Majesty knows,\" said the Woodpecker, \"that I am Chief Beater of\\r\\nthe War-gong, I sounded the gong because I saw the Great Lizard\\r\\nwearing his sword.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Send for the Great Lizard,\" said King Solomon. When the Great Lizard\\r\\ncame, he asked him, \"Was it you who were wearing your sword?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, your Majesty,\" said the Great Lizard; \"but I had to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why?\" said the king.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your Majesty knows,\" said the Great Lizard, \"that I am Chief Protector\\r\\nof the Sword. I wore my sword because the Tortoise came wearing his coat\\r\\nof mail.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Tortoise was sent for.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did you wear your coat of mail?\" said the king.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I put it on, your Majesty,\" said the Tortoise, \"because I saw the\\r\\nKing-crab trailing his three-edged pike.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the King-crab was sent for.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why were you trailing your three-edged pike?\" said King Solomon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because, your Majesty,\" said the King-crab, \"I saw that the Crayfish\\r\\nhad shouldered his lance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately the Crayfish was sent for.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did you shoulder your lance?\" said the king.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because, your Majesty,\" said the Crayfish, \"I saw the Otter coming down\\r\\nto the river to kill my children.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" said King Solomon, \"if that is the case, the Otter killed the\\r\\nOtter\\'s children. And the Mouse-deer cannot be blamed, by the law of the\\r\\nland!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEARLY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     I like to lie wait to see\\r\\n       My mother braid her hair.\\r\\n     It is as long as it can be,\\r\\n       And yet she doesn\\'t care.\\r\\n     I love my mother\\'s hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n     And then the way her fingers go;\\r\\n       They look so quick white,--\\r\\n     In out, to fro,\\r\\n       And braiding in the light,\\r\\n     And it is always right.\\r\\n\\r\\n     So then she winds it, shiny brown,\\r\\n     Around her head into a crown,\\r\\n       Just like the day before.\\r\\n     And then she looks pats it down,\\r\\n       And looks a minute more;\\r\\n     While I stay here all still cool.\\r\\n     Oh, isn\\'t morning beautiful?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BRAHMIN, THE TIGER, AND THE JACKAL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you know what a Brahmin is? A Brahmin is a very good gentle kind\\r\\nof man who lives in India, who treats all the beasts as if they were\\r\\nhis brothers. There is a great deal more to know about Brahmins, but\\r\\nthat is enough for the story.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day a Brahmin was walking along a country road when he came upon a\\r\\nTiger, shut up in a strong iron cage. The villagers had caught him and\\r\\nshut him up there for his wickedness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Brother Brahmin, Brother Brahmin,\" said the Tiger, \"please let me\\r\\nout, to get a little drink! I am so thirsty, there is no water\\r\\nhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But Brother Tiger,\" said the Brahmin, \"you know if I should let you\\r\\nout, you would spring on me eat me up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never, Brother Brahmin!\" said the Tiger. \"Never in the world would I do\\r\\nsuch an ungrateful thing! Just let me out a little minute, to get a\\r\\nlittle, little drink of water, Brother Brahmin!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Brahmin unlocked the door let the Tiger out. The moment he\\r\\nwas out he sprang on the Brahmin, was about to eat him up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, Brother Tiger,\" said the Brahmin, \"you promised you would not. It\\r\\nis not fair or just that you should eat me, when I set you free.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is perfectly right just,\" said the Tiger, \"I shall eat you\\r\\nup.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the Brahmin argued so hard that at last the Tiger agreed to\\r\\nwait ask the first five whom they should meet, whether it was fair\\r\\nfor him to eat the Brahmin, to abide by their decision.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first thing they came to, to ask, was an old Banyan Tree, by the\\r\\nwayside. (A banyan tree is a kind of fruit tree.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Brother Banyan,\" said the Brahmin, eagerly, \"does it seem to you right\\r\\nor just that this Tiger should eat me, when I set him free from his\\r\\ncage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Banyan Tree looked down at them spoke in a tired voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the summer,\" he said, \"when the sun is hot, men come sit in the\\r\\ncool of my shade refresh themselves with the fruit of my branches.\\r\\nBut when evening falls, they are rested, they break my twigs and\\r\\nscatter my leaves, stone my boughs for more fruit. Men are an\\r\\nungrateful race. Let the Tiger eat the Brahmin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tiger sprang to eat the Brahmin, but the Brahmin said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait, wait; we have asked only one. We have still four to ask.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently they came to a place where an old Bullock was lying by the\\r\\nroad. The Brahmin went up to him said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Brother Bullock, oh, Brother Bullock, does it seem to you a fair thing\\r\\nthat this Tiger should eat me up, after I have just freed him from a\\r\\ncage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bullock looked up, answered in a deep, grumbling voice,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I was young strong my master used me hard, I served him\\r\\nwell. I carried heavy loads carried them far. Now that I am old and\\r\\nweak cannot work, he leaves me without food or water, to die by the\\r\\nwayside. Men are a thankless lot. Let the Tiger eat the Brahmin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tiger sprang, but the Brahmin spoke very quickly,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, but this is only the second, Brother Tiger; you promised to ask\\r\\nfive.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tiger grumbled a good deal, but at last he went on again with the\\r\\nBrahmin. And after a time they saw an Eagle, high overhead. The Brahmin\\r\\ncalled up to him imploringly,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Brother Eagle, Brother Eagle! Tell us if it seems to you fair that\\r\\nthis Tiger should eat me up, when I have just saved him from a frightful\\r\\ncage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eagle soared slowly overhead a moment, then he came lower, spoke\\r\\nin a thin, clear voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I live high in the air,\" he said, \"I do no man any harm. Yet as\\r\\noften as they find my eyrie, men stone my young rob my nest and\\r\\nshoot at me with arrows. Men are a cruel breed. Let the Tiger eat the\\r\\nBrahmin!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tiger sprang upon the Brahmin, to eat him up; this time the\\r\\nBrahmin had very hard work to persuade him to wait. At last he did\\r\\npersuade him, however, they walked on together. And in a little\\r\\nwhile they saw an old Alligator, lying half buried in mud slime, at\\r\\nthe river\\'s edge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Brother Alligator, oh, Brother Alligator!\" said the Brahmin, \"does it\\r\\nseem at all right or fair to you that this Tiger should eat me up, when\\r\\nI have just now let him out of a cage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Alligator turned in the mud, grunted, snorted; then he\\r\\nsaid,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I lie here in the mud all day, as harmless as a pigeon; I hunt no man,\\r\\nyet every time a man sees me, he throws stones at me, pokes me with\\r\\nsharp sticks, jeers at me. Men are a worthless lot. Let the Tiger\\r\\neat the Brahmin!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this the Tiger was going to eat the Brahmin at once. The poor Brahmin\\r\\nhad to remind him, again again, that they had asked only four.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait till we\\'ve asked one more! Wait until we see a fifth!\" he begged.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, the Tiger walked on with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a time, they met the little Jackal, coming gaily down the road\\r\\ntoward them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Brother Jackal, dear Brother Jackal,\" said the Brahmin, \"give us\\r\\nyour opinion! Do you think it right or fair that this Tiger should eat\\r\\nme, when I set him free from a terrible cage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Beg pardon?\" said the little Jackal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I said,\" said the Brahmin, raising his voice, \"do you think it is fair\\r\\nthat the Tiger should eat me, when I set him free from his cage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cage?\" said the little Jackal, vacantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes, his cage,\" said the Brahmin. \"We want your opinion. Do you\\r\\nthink----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" said the little Jackal, \"you want my opinion? Then may I beg you\\r\\nto speak a little more loudly, make the matter quite clear? I am a\\r\\nlittle slow of understanding. Now what was it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you think,\" said the Brahmin, \"it is right for this Tiger to eat me,\\r\\nwhen I set him free from his cage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What cage?\" said the little Jackal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, the cage he was in,\" said the Brahmin. \"You see----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I don\\'t altogether understand,\" said the little Jackal. \"You \\'set\\r\\nhim free,\\' you say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes, yes!\" said the Brahmin. \"It was this way: I was walking\\r\\nalong, I saw the Tiger----\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, dear, dear!\" interrupted the little Jackal; \"I never can see\\r\\nthrough it, if you go on like that, with a long story. If you really\\r\\nwant my opinion you must make the matter clear. What sort of cage was\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, a big, ordinary cage, an iron cage,\" said the Brahmin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That gives me no idea at all,\" said the little Jackal. \"See here, my\\r\\nfriends, if we are to get on with this matter you\\'d best show me the\\r\\nspot. Then I can understin a jiffy. Show me the cage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Brahmin, the Tiger, the little Jackal walked back together to\\r\\nthe spot where the cage was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, let us understthe situation,\" said the little Jackal. \"Friend\\r\\nBrahmin, where were you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I stood just here by the roadside,\" said the Brahmin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tiger, where were you?\" said the little Jackal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, in the cage, of course,\" roared the Tiger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon, Father Tiger,\" said the little Jackal, \"I\\r\\nreally am _so_ stupid; I cannot _quite_ understwhat happened. If you\\r\\nwill have a little patience,--_how_ were you in the cage? What position\\r\\nwere you in?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I stood here,\" said the Tiger, leaping into the cage, \"with my head\\r\\nover my shoulder, so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, thank you, thank you,\" said the little Jackal, \"that makes it\\r\\n_much_ clearer; but I still don\\'t _quite_ understand--forgive my slow\\r\\nmind--why did you not come out, by yourself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t you see that the door shut me in?\" said the Tiger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I do beg your pardon,\" said the little Jackal. \"I know I am very\\r\\nslow; I can never understthings well unless I see just how they\\r\\nwere; if you could show me now exactly how that door works I am sure I\\r\\ncould understand. How does it shut?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It shuts like this,\" said the Brahmin, pushing it to.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; but I don\\'t see any lock,\" said the little Jackal, \"does it lock\\r\\non the outside?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It locks like this,\" said the Brahmin. And he shut bolted the door!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, does it, indeed?\" said the little Jackal. \"Does it, _indeed_! Well,\\r\\nBrother Brahmin, now that it is locked, I should advise you to let it\\r\\nstay locked! As for you, my friend,\" he said to the Tiger, \"I think you\\r\\nwill wait a good while before you\\'ll find anyone to let you out again!\"\\r\\nThen he made a very low bow to the Brahmin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-bye, Brother,\" he said. \"Your way lies that way, mine lies\\r\\nthis; good-bye!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LITTLE JACKAL AND THE CAMEL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these stories about the little Jackal that I have told you, show how\\r\\nclever the little Jackal was. But you know--if you don\\'t, you will when\\r\\nyou are grown up--that no matter how clever you are, sooner or later you\\r\\nsurely meet some one who is more clever. It is always so in life. And it\\r\\nwas so with the little Jackal. This is what happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Jackal was, as you know, exceedingly fond of shell-fish,\\r\\nespecially of river crabs. Now there came a time when he had eaten all\\r\\nthe crabs to be found on his own side of the river. He knew there must\\r\\nbe plenty on the other side, if he could only get to them, but he could\\r\\nnot swim.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day he thought of a plan. He went to his friend the Camel, and\\r\\nsaid,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Friend Camel, I know a spot where the sugar-cane grows thick; I\\'ll show\\r\\nyou the way, if you will take me there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I will,\" said the Camel, who was very fond of sugar-cane. \"Where\\r\\nis it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is on the other side of the river,\" said the little Jackal; \"but we\\r\\ncan manage it nicely, if you will take me on your back swim over.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Camel was perfectly willing, so the little Jackal jumped on his\\r\\nback, the Camel swam across the river, carrying him. When they were\\r\\nsafely over, the little Jackal jumped down showed the Camel the\\r\\nsugar-cane field; then he ran swiftly along the river bank, to hunt for\\r\\ncrabs; the Camel began to eat sugar-cane. He ate happily, noticed\\r\\nnothing around him.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, you know, a Camel is very big, a Jackal is very little.\\r\\nConsequently, the little Jackal had eaten his fill by the time the Camel\\r\\nhad barely taken a mouthful. The little Jackal had no mind to wait for\\r\\nhis slow friend; he wanted to be off home again, about his business. So\\r\\nhe ran round round the sugar-cane field, as he ran he sang and\\r\\nshouted, made a great hullabaloo.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, the villagers heard him at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is a Jackal in the sugar-cane,\" they said; \"he will dig holes and\\r\\ndestroy the roots; we must go down drive him out.\" So they came\\r\\ndown, with sticks stones. When they got there, there was no Jackal\\r\\nto be seen; but they saw the great Camel, eating away at the juicy\\r\\nsugar-cane. They ran at him beat him, stoned him, drove him\\r\\naway half dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they had gone, leaving the poor Camel half killed, the little\\r\\nJackal came dancing back from somewhere or other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think it\\'s time to go home, now,\" he said; \"don\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you _are_ a pretty friend!\" said the Camel. \"The idea of your\\r\\nmaking such a noise, with your shouting singing! You brought this\\r\\nupon me. What in the world made you do it? Why did you shout sing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know _why_\" said the little Jackal,--\"I always sing after\\r\\ndinner!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So?\" said the Camel. \"Ah, very well, let us go home now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took the little Jackal kindly on his back started into the water.\\r\\nWhen he began to swim he swam out to where the river was the very\\r\\ndeepest. There he stopped, said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Jackal!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said the little Jackal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have the strangest feeling,\" said the Camel,--\"I feel as if I must\\r\\nroll over.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Roll over\\'!\" cried the Jackal. \"My goodness, don\\'t do that! If you do\\r\\nthat, you\\'ll drown me! What in the world makes you want to do such a\\r\\ncrazy thing? Why should you want to roll over?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know _why_,\" said the Camel slowly, \"but I always roll over\\r\\nafter dinner!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he rolled over.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the little Jackal was drowned, for his sins, but the Camel came\\r\\nsafely home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GULLS OF SALT LAKE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story I am going to tell you is about something that really\\r\\nhappened, many years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nA brave little company of pioneers from the Atlantic coast crossed the\\r\\nMississippi River journeyed across the plains of Central North\\r\\nAmerica in big covered wagons with many horses, finally succeeded in\\r\\nclimbing to the top of the great Rockies down again into a valley in\\r\\nthe very midst of the mountains. It was a valley of brown, bare, desert\\r\\nsoil, in a climate where almost no rain falls; but the snow on the\\r\\nmountain-tops sent down little streams of pure water, the winds were\\r\\ngentle, lying like a blue jewel at the foot of the western hills was\\r\\na marvellous lake of salt water,--an inlsea. So the pioneers settled\\r\\nthere built themselves huts cabins for the first winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had taken them many months to make the terrible journey; many had\\r\\ndied of weariness illness on the way; many died of hardship during\\r\\nthe winter; the provisions they had brought in their wagons were so\\r\\nnearly gone that, by spring, they were living partly on roots, dug from\\r\\nthe ground. All their lives now depended on the crops of grain and\\r\\nvegetables which they could raise in the valley. They made the barren\\r\\nlfertile by spreading water from the little streams over it,--what\\r\\nwe call \"irrigating\"; they planted enough corn grain and\\r\\nvegetables for all the people. Every one helped, every one watched\\r\\nfor the sprouting, with hopes, prayers, careful eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn good time the seeds sprouted, the dry, brown earth was covered\\r\\nwith a carpet of tender, green, growing things. No farmer\\'s garden could\\r\\nhave looked better than the great garden of the desert valley. And from\\r\\nday to day the little shoots grew flourished till they were all well\\r\\nabove the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen a terrible thing happened. One day, the men who were watering the\\r\\ncrops saw a great number of crickets swarming over the ground at the\\r\\nedge of the gardens nearest the mountains. They were hopping from the\\r\\nbarren places into the young, green crops, as they settled down they\\r\\nate the tiny shoots leaves to the ground. More came, more, and\\r\\never more, as they came they spread out till they covered a big\\r\\ncorner of the grain field. And still more more, till it was like an\\r\\narmy of black, hopping, crawling crickets, streaming down the side of\\r\\nthe mountain to kill the crops.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men tried to kill the crickets by beating them down, but the\\r\\nnumbers were so great that it was like beating at the sea. Then they ran\\r\\ntold the terrible news, all the village came to help. They\\r\\nstarted fires; they dug trenches filled them with water; they ran\\r\\nwildly about in the fields, killing what they could. But while they\\r\\nfought in one place new armies of crickets marched down the\\r\\nmountain-sides attacked the fields in other places. And at last the\\r\\npeople fell on their knees wept cried in despair, for they saw\\r\\nstarvation death in the fields.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few knelt to pray. Others gathered round joined them, weeping.\\r\\nMore left their useless struggles knelt beside their neighbours. At\\r\\nlast nearly all the people were kneeling on the desolate fields praying\\r\\nfor deliverance from the plague of crickets.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, from far off in the air toward the great salt lake, there was\\r\\nthe sound of flapping wings. It grew louder. Some of the people looked\\r\\nup, startled. They saw, like a white cloud rising from the lake, a flock\\r\\nof sea gulls flying toward them. Snow-white in the sun, with great wings\\r\\nbeating soaring, in hundreds hundreds, they rose circled and\\r\\ncame on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The gulls! the gulls!\" was the cry. \"What does it mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gulls flew overhead, with a shrill chorus of whimpering cries, and\\r\\nthen, in a marvellous white cloud of outspread wings hovering\\r\\nbreasts, they settled down over the cultivated ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! woe! woe!\" cried the people. \"The gulls are eating what the\\r\\ncrickets have left! they will strip root branch!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut all at once, someone called out,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no! See! they are eating the crickets! They are eating only the\\r\\ncrickets!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was true. The gulls devoured the crickets in dozens, in hundreds, in\\r\\nswarms. They ate until they were gorged, then they flew heavily back\\r\\nto the lake, only to come again with new appetite. And when at last they\\r\\nfinished, they had stripped the fields of the army of crickets; the\\r\\npeople were saved.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this day, in the beautiful city of Salt Lake, which grew out of that\\r\\npioneer village, the little children are taught to love the sea gulls.\\r\\nAnd when they learn drawing weaving in the schools, their first\\r\\ndesign is often a picture of a cricket a gull.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE NIGHTINGALE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA long, long time ago, as long ago as when there were fairies, there\\r\\nlived an emperor in China, who had a most beautiful palace, all made of\\r\\ncrystal. Outside the palace was the loveliest garden in the whole world,\\r\\nfarther away was a forest where the trees were taller than any other\\r\\ntrees in the world, farther away, still, was a deep wood. And in\\r\\nthis wood lived a little Nightingale. The Nightingale sang so\\r\\nbeautifully that everybody who heard her remembered her song better than\\r\\nanything else that he heard or saw. People came from all over the world\\r\\nto see the crystal palace the wonderful garden the great forest;\\r\\nbut when they went home wrote books about these things they always\\r\\nwrote, \"But the Nightingale is the best of all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last it happened that the Emperor came upon a book which said this,\\r\\nhe at once sent for his Chamberlain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is this Nightingale?\" said the Emperor. \"Why have I never heard him\\r\\nsing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chamberlain, who was a very important person, said, \"There cannot be\\r\\nany such person; I have never heard his name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The book says there is a Nightingale,\" said the Emperor. \"I command\\r\\nthat the Nightingale be brought here to sing for me this evening.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chamberlain went out asked all the great lords ladies and\\r\\npages where the Nightingale could be found, but not one of them had ever\\r\\nheard of him. So the Chamberlain went back to the Emperor said,\\r\\n\"There is no such person.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The book says there is a Nightingale,\" said the Emperor; \"if the\\r\\nNightingale is not here to sing for me this evening I will have the\\r\\ncourt trampled upon, immediately after supper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chamberlain did not want to be trampled upon, so he ran out and\\r\\nasked everybody in the palace about the Nightingale. At last, a little\\r\\ngirl who worked in the kitchen to help the cook, said, \"Oh, yes, I know\\r\\nthe Nightingale very well. Every night, when I go to carry scraps from\\r\\nthe kitchen to my mother, who lives in the wood beyond the forest, I\\r\\nhear the Nightingale sing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chamberlain asked the maid to take him to the Nightingale\\'s home,\\r\\nmany of the lords ladies followed after. When they had gone a\\r\\nlittle way, they heard a cow moo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said the lords ladies, \"that must be the Nightingale; what a\\r\\nlarge voice for so small a creature!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no,\" said the little girl, \"that is just a cow, mooing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA little farther on they heard some bullfrogs, in a swamp. \"Surely that\\r\\nis the Nightingale,\" said the courtiers; \"it really sounds like\\r\\nchurch-bells!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no,\" said the little girl, \"those are bullfrogs, croaking.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last they came to the wood where the Nightingale was. \"Hush!\" said\\r\\nthe little girl, \"she is going to sing.\" And, sure enough, the little\\r\\nNightingale began to sing. She sang so beautifully that you have never\\r\\nin all your life heard anything like it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear, dear,\" said the courtiers, \"that is very pleasant; does that\\r\\nlittle grey bird really make all that noise? She is so pale that I think\\r\\nshe has lost her colour for fear of us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chamberlain asked the little Nightingale to come sing for the\\r\\nEmperor. The little Nightingale said she could sing better in her own\\r\\ngreenwood, but she was so sweet kind that she came with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat evening the palace was all trimmed with the most beautiful flowers\\r\\nyou can imagine, rows rows of little silver bells, that tinkled\\r\\nwhen the wind blew in, hundreds hundreds hundreds of wax\\r\\ncandles, that shone like tiny stars. In the great hall there was a gold\\r\\nperch for the Nightingale, beside the Emperor\\'s throne.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen all the people were there, the Emperor asked the Nightingale to\\r\\nsing. Then the little grey Nightingale filled her throat full, sang.\\r\\nAnd, my dears, she sang so beautifully that the Emperor\\'s eyes filled up\\r\\nwith tears! And, you know, emperors do not cry at all easily. So he\\r\\nasked her to sing again, this time she sang so marvellously that\\r\\nthe tears came out of his eyes ran down his cheeks. That was a great\\r\\nsuccess. They asked the little Nightingale to sing, over over again,\\r\\nwhen they had listened enough the Emperor said that she should be\\r\\nmade \"Singer in Chief to the Court.\" She was to have a golden perch near\\r\\nthe Emperor\\'s bed, a little golden cage, was to be allowed to go\\r\\nout twice every day. But there were twelve servants appointed to wait on\\r\\nher, those twelve servants went with her every time she went out,\\r\\neach of the twelve had hold of the end of a silken string which was\\r\\ntied to the little Nightingale\\'s leg! It was not so very much fun to go\\r\\nout that way!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long, long time the Nightingale sang every evening to the Emperor\\r\\nhis court, they liked her so much that the ladies all tried to\\r\\nsing like her; they used to put water in their mouths then make\\r\\nlittle sounds like this: _glu-glu-glug_. And when the courtiers met each\\r\\nother in the halls, one would say \"Night,\" the other would say\\r\\n\"ingale,\" that was supposed to be conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, one day, there came a little package to the Emperor, on the\\r\\noutside of which was written, \"The Nightingale.\" Inside was an\\r\\nartificial bird, something like a Nightingale, only it was made of gold,\\r\\nsilver, rubies, emeralds, diamonds. When it was wound\\r\\nup it played a waltz tune, as it played it moved its little tail up\\r\\ndown. Everybody in the court was filled with delight at the music of\\r\\nthe new nightingale. They made it sing that same tune thirty-three\\r\\ntimes, still they had not had enough. They would have made it sing\\r\\nthe tune thirty-four times, but the Emperor said, \"I should like to hear\\r\\nthe real Nightingale sing, now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when they looked about for the real little Nightingale, they could\\r\\nnot find her anywhere! She had taken the chance, while everybody was\\r\\nlistening to the waltz tunes, to fly away through the window to her own\\r\\ngreenwood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a very ungrateful bird!\" said the lords ladies. \"But it does\\r\\nnot matter; the new nightingale is just as good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the artificial nightingale was given the real Nightingale\\'s little\\r\\ngold perch, every night the Emperor wound her up, she sang waltz\\r\\ntunes to him. The people in the court liked her even better than the old\\r\\nNightingale, because they could all whistle her tunes,--which you can\\'t\\r\\ndo with real nightingales.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout a year after the artificial nightingale came, the Emperor was\\r\\nlistening to her waltz tune, when there was a _snap_ _whir-r-r_\\r\\ninside the bird, the music stopped. The Emperor ran to his doctor,\\r\\nbut he could not do anything. Then he ran to his clock-maker, but he\\r\\ncould not do much. Nobody could do much. The best they could do was to\\r\\npatch the gold nightingale up so that it could sing once a year; even\\r\\nthat was almost too much, the tune was very shaky. Still, the\\r\\nEmperor kept the gold nightingale on the perch in his own room.\\r\\n\\r\\nA long time went by, then, at last, the Emperor grew very ill, and\\r\\nwas about to die. When it was sure that he could not live much longer,\\r\\nthe people chose a new emperor waited for the old one to die. The\\r\\npoor Emperor lay, quite cold pale, in his great big bed, with velvet\\r\\ncurtains tall candlesticks all about. He was quite alone, for all\\r\\nthe courtiers had gone to congratulate the new emperor, all the\\r\\nservants had gone to talk it over.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Emperor woke up, he felt a terrible weight on his chest. He\\r\\nopened his eyes, there was Death, sitting on his heart. Death had\\r\\nput on the Emperor\\'s gold crown, he had the gold sceptre in one\\r\\nhand, the silken banner in the other; he looked at the Emperor\\r\\nwith his great hollow eyes. The room was full of shadows, the\\r\\nshadows were full of faces. Everywhere the Emperor looked, there were\\r\\nfaces. Some were very, very ugly, some were sweet lovely; they\\r\\nwere all the things the Emperor had done in his life, good bad. And\\r\\nas he looked at them they began to whisper. They whispered, \"_Do you\\r\\nremember this?_\" \"_Do you remember that?_\" The Emperor remembered so\\r\\nmuch that he cried out loud, \"Oh, bring the great drum! Make music, so\\r\\nthat I may not hear these dreadful whispers!\" But there was nobody there\\r\\nto bring the drum.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Emperor cried, \"You little gold nightingale, can you not sing\\r\\nsomething for me? I have given you gifts of gold jewels, kept\\r\\nyou always by my side; will you not help me now?\" But there was nobody\\r\\nto wind the little gold nightingale up, of course it could not sing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Emperor\\'s heart grew colder colder where Death crouched upon it,\\r\\nthe dreadful whispers grew louder louder, the Emperor\\'s life\\r\\nwas almost gone. Suddenly, through the open window, there came a most\\r\\nlovely song. It was so sweet so loud that the whispers died quite\\r\\naway. Presently the Emperor felt his heart grow warm, then he felt the\\r\\nblood flow through his limbs again; he listened to the song until the\\r\\ntears ran down his cheeks; he knew that it was the little real\\r\\nNightingale who had flown away from him when the gold nightingale came.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath was listening to the song, too; when it was done the\\r\\nEmperor begged for more, Death, too, said, \"Please sing again, little\\r\\nNightingale!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you give me the Emperor\\'s gold crown for a song?\" said the little\\r\\nNightingale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Death; the little Nightingale bought the Emperor\\'s crown\\r\\nfor a song.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, sing again, little Nightingale,\" begged Death.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you give me the Emperor\\'s sceptre for another song?\" said the\\r\\nlittle grey Nightingale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Death; the little Nightingale bought the Emperor\\'s\\r\\nsceptre for another song.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more Death begged for a song, this time the little Nightingale\\r\\nobtained the banner for her singing. Then she sang one more song, so\\r\\nsweet so sad that it made Death think of his garden in the\\r\\nchurchyard, where he always liked best to be. And he rose from the\\r\\nEmperor\\'s heart floated away through the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Death was gone, the Emperor said to the little Nightingale, \"Oh,\\r\\ndear little Nightingale, you have saved me from Death! Do not leave me\\r\\nagain. Stay with me on this little gold perch, sing to me always!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, dear Emperor,\" said the little Nightingale, \"I sing best when I am\\r\\nfree; I cannot live in a palace. But every night when you are quite\\r\\nalone, I will come sit in the window sing to you, tell you\\r\\neverything that goes on in your kingdom: I will tell you where the poor\\r\\npeople are who ought to be helped, where the wicked people are who\\r\\nought to be punished. Only, dear Emperor, be sure that you never let\\r\\nanybody know that you have a little bird who tells you everything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the little Nightingale had flown away, the Emperor felt so well\\r\\nstrong that he dressed himself in his royal robes took his gold\\r\\nsceptre in his hand. And when the courtiers came in to see if he were\\r\\ndead, there stood the Emperor with his sword in one hhis sceptre\\r\\nin the other, said, \"Good-morning!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMARGERY\\'S GARDEN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a little girl named Margery, who had always lived in the\\r\\ncity. The flat where her mother father lived was at the top of a big\\r\\nbuilding, you couldn\\'t see a great deal from the windows, except\\r\\nchimney-pots on other people\\'s roofs. Margery did not know much about\\r\\ntrees flowers, but she loved them dearly; whenever it was a fine\\r\\nSunday she used to go with her mother father to the park look at\\r\\nthe lovely flower-beds. They seemed always to be finished, though, and\\r\\nMargery was always wishing she could see them grow.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne spring, when Margery was nine, her father obtained a new situation\\r\\nthey removed to a little house with a nice big piece of ground a\\r\\nshort distance outside the town where his new position was. Margery was\\r\\ndelighted. And the very first thing she said, when her father told her\\r\\nabout it, was, \"Oh, may I have a garden? _May_ I have a garden?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMargery\\'s mother was almost as eager for a garden as she was, and\\r\\nMargery\\'s father said he expected to live on their vegetables all the\\r\\nrest of his life! So it was soon agreed that the garden should be the\\r\\nfirst thing attended to.\\r\\n\\r\\nBehind the cottage were apple trees, a plum tree, two or three pear\\r\\ntrees; then came a stretch of rough grass, then a stone wall, with a\\r\\ngate leading into the fields. It was on the grass plot that the garden\\r\\nwas to be. A big piece was to be used for wheat peas beans, and\\r\\na little piece at the end was to be given to Margery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What shall we have in it?\" asked her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Flowers,\" said Margery, with shining eyes,--\"blue, white, and\\r\\nyellow, pink,--every kind of flower!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Surely, flowers,\" said her mother, \"shall we not have a little\\r\\nsalad garden in the middle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is a salad garden?\" Margery asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a garden where you have all the things that make nice salad,\"\\r\\nsaid her mother, laughing, for Margery was fond of salads; \"you have\\r\\nlettuce, endive, mustard cress, parsley, radishes,\\r\\nbeetroot, young onions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! how good it sounds!\" said Margery. \"I should love a salad garden.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat very evening, Margery\\'s father took pencil paper, drew out\\r\\na plan for her garden; first, they talked it all over, then he drew what\\r\\nthey decided on; it looked like the diagram on the next page.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The outside strip is for flowers,\" said Margery\\'s father, \"next is\\r\\na footpath, all the way round the beds; that is to let you get at the\\r\\nflowers to weed to pick; there is a wider path through the middle,\\r\\nthe rest is for rows of salad vegetables.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Papa, it is glorious!\" said Margery.\\r\\n\\r\\nPapa laughed. \"I hope you will still think it glorious when the weeding\\r\\ntime comes,\" he said, \"for you know, you mother have promised to\\r\\ntake care of this garden, while I take care of the big one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wouldn\\'t _not_ take care of it for anything!\" said Margery. \"I want\\r\\nto feel that it is my very own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father kissed her, said it was certainly her \"very own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo evenings after that, when Margery was called in from her first\\r\\nramble in the fields, she found the postman at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Something for you, Margery,\" said her mother, with the look she had\\r\\nwhen something nice was happening.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a box, quite a big box, with a label on it that said:--\\r\\n\\r\\n     MISS MARGERY BROWN,\\r\\n         PRIMROSE COTTAGE,\\r\\n               21 NARCISSUS ROAD,\\r\\n                     COLCHESTER.\\r\\n\\r\\n     From Seeds Plants Company, Reading.\\r\\n\\r\\nMargery could hardly wait to open it. It was filled with little\\r\\npackages, all with printed labels; in the packages, of course, were\\r\\nseeds. It made Margery dance, just to read the names,--nasturtium, giant\\r\\nhelianthus, canariensis, calendula, Canterbury bells: more names than I\\r\\ncan tell you; other packages, bigger, that said, \"Sweet Peas,\"\\r\\n\"French beans,\" \"Carrots,\" \"Wallflowers,\" such things! Margery could\\r\\nalmost smell the posies, she was so excited. Only, she had seen so\\r\\nlittle of flowers that she did not know what all the names meant. She\\r\\ndid not know that a helianthus was a sunflower until her mother told her\\r\\nso, she had never seen the dear, blue, bell-shaped flowers that\\r\\nalways grow in old-fashioned gardens, are called Canterbury bells.\\r\\nShe thought the calendula must be a strange, grflower, by its name;\\r\\nbut her mother told her it was the gay, sturdy, everydayish little\\r\\nflower called a marigold. There was a great deal for a little city girl\\r\\nto be surprised about, it did seem as if morning was a long way off!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you think you could plant them in the morning?\" asked her mother.\\r\\n\"You know, dear, the ground has to be made ready first; it takes a\\r\\nlittle time,--it may be several days before you can plant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was another surprise. Margery had thought she could begin to sow\\r\\nthe seed right off.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this was what had happened. Early the next morning, a man came\\r\\ndriving up to the cottage with two strong white horses; in his wagon was\\r\\na plough. I suppose you have seen ploughs, but Margery never had, and\\r\\nshe watched with great interest, while the man her father took the\\r\\nplough from the cart harnessed the horses to it. It was a great,\\r\\nthree-cornered piece of sharp steel, with long handles coming up from\\r\\nit, so that a man could hold it in place. It looked like this:--\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I brought a two-horse plough because it\\'s virgin soil,\" the man said.\\r\\nMargery wondered what in the world he meant; it had not been\\r\\ncultivated, of course, but what had that do with the kind of plough?\\r\\n\"What does he mean, father?\" she whispered, when she got a chance. \"He\\r\\nmeans that this lhas not been ploughed before; it will be hard to\\r\\nturn the soil, one horse could not pull the plough,\" said her\\r\\nfather.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt took the man two hours to plough the little strip of land. He drove\\r\\nthe sharp end of the plough into the soil, held it firmly so, while\\r\\nthe horses drew it along in a straight line. Margery found it\\r\\nfascinating to watch the long line of dark earth green grass come\\r\\nrolling up turn over, as the knife passed it. She could see that it\\r\\ntook real skill strength to keep the line even, to avoid the\\r\\nstones. Sometimes the plough struck a hidden stone, then the man was\\r\\njerked almost off his feet. But he only laughed, said, \"Tough piece\\r\\nof land; it will be a lot better next year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had ploughed, the man went back to his cart unloaded another\\r\\nfarm implement. This one was like a three-cornered platform of wood,\\r\\nwith a long, curved, strong rake under it. It was called a harrow, and\\r\\nit looked like the diagram on the next page.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man harnessed the horses to it, then he stood on the platform\\r\\ndrove all over the strip of land. It was fun to watch, but perhaps\\r\\nit was a little hard to do. The man\\'s weight kept the harrow steady,\\r\\nlet the teeth of the rake scratch cut the ground up, so that it\\r\\ndid not stay in ridges.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He scrambles the ground, father!\" said Margery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It needs \\'scrambling,\\'\" laughed her father. \"We are going to get more\\r\\nweeds than we want on this fresh soil, the more the ground is\\r\\nbroken, the fewer there will be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the ploughing harrowing, the man drove off, Margery\\'s\\r\\nfather said that he himself would do the rest of the work in the late\\r\\nafternoons, when he came home from business; they could not afford too\\r\\nmuch help, he said, he had learned to take care of a garden when he\\r\\nwas a boy. So Margery did not see any more done until the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the next day there was hard work for Margery\\'s father! Every bit of\\r\\nthat ground had to be broken up still more with a spade, then the\\r\\nclods which were full of grass-roots had to be taken on a fork and\\r\\nshaken, till the earth fell out; when the grass was thrown to one side.\\r\\nThat would not have had to be done if the lhad been ploughed in the\\r\\nautumn; the grass would have rotted in the ground, would have made\\r\\nfood for the plants. Now, Margery\\'s father put the fertiliser on the\\r\\ntop, then raked it into the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, it was time to make the place for the seeds. Margery her\\r\\nmother helped. Father tied one end of a cord to a little stake, and\\r\\ndrove the stake in the ground at one end of the garden. Then he took the\\r\\ncord to the other end of the garden pulled it tight, tied it to\\r\\nanother stake, drove that down. That made a straight line. Then he\\r\\nhoed a trench, a few inches deep, the whole length of the cord, and\\r\\nscattered fertiliser in it. Pretty soon the whole garden was lined with\\r\\nlittle trenches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now for the seed,\" said father.\\r\\n\\r\\nMargery ran brought the seed box. \"May I help?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you watch me sow one row, I think you can do the next,\" said her\\r\\nfather.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Margery watched. Her father took a handful of peas, and, stooping,\\r\\nwalked slowly along the line, letting the seed trickle through his\\r\\nfingers. It was pretty to watch; it made Margery think of a photograph\\r\\nher teacher had, a photograph of a famous picture called \"The Sower.\"\\r\\nPerhaps you have seen it.\\r\\n\\r\\nPutting in the seed was not so easy to do as to watch; sometimes Margery\\r\\ndropped in too much, sometimes not enough; but her father was\\r\\npatient with her, soon she did better.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey planted peas, beans, spinach, carrots, parsnips. And Margery\\'s\\r\\nfather made a row of holes, after that, for the tomato plants. He said\\r\\nthose had to be transplanted; they could not be sown from seed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the seeds were in the trenches they had to be covered up, and\\r\\nMargery really helped at that. It is fun to do it. You stbeside the\\r\\nlittle trench walk backward, as you walk you hoe the loose earth\\r\\nback over the seeds; the same earth that was hoed up you pull back\\r\\nagain. Then you rake very gently over the surface, with the back of a\\r\\nrake, to even it all off. Margery liked it, because now the garden began\\r\\nto look _like_ a garden.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut best of all was the work next day, when her own little particular\\r\\ngarden was begun. Father Brown loved Margery Margery\\'s mother so\\r\\nmuch that he wanted their garden to be perfect, that meant a great\\r\\ndeal more work. He knew very well that the old grass would begin to come\\r\\nthrough again on such soil, that it would make terribly hard\\r\\nweeding. He was not going to have any such thing for his two \"little\\r\\ngirls,\" as he called them. So he gave that little garden particular\\r\\nattention. This is what he did.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter he had thrown out all the turf, he shovelled clean earth on to the\\r\\ngarden,--as much as three solid inches of it; not a bit of grass was in\\r\\nthat. Then it was ready for raking fertilising, for the lines.\\r\\nThe little footpaths were marked out by Father Brown\\'s feet; Margery and\\r\\nher mother laughed well at his actions, for it looked like some kind of\\r\\ndance. Mr Brown had seen gardeners do it when he was a little boy, and\\r\\nhe did it very nicely: he walked along the sides of the square, with one\\r\\nfoot turned a little out, the other straight, taking such tiny steps\\r\\nthat his feet touched each other all the time. This tramped out a path\\r\\njust wide enough for a person to walk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wider path was marked with lines raked.\\r\\n\\r\\nMargery thought, of course, all the flowers would be put in as the\\r\\nvegetables were; but she found that it was not so. For some, her father\\r\\npoked little holes with his finger; for some, he made very shallow\\r\\ntrenches; some very small seeds were scattered lightly over the top\\r\\nof the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nMargery her mother had taken so much pains in thinking out the\\r\\narrangement of the flowers, that perhaps you will like to hear just how\\r\\nthey designed that garden. At the back were the sweet peas, which would\\r\\ngrow tall, like a screen; on the two sides, for a kind of hedge, were\\r\\nyellow sunflowers; along the front edge were the gay nasturtiums.\\r\\nMargery planned that, so that she could look into the garden from the\\r\\nfront, but have it shut away from the vegetable patch by the tall\\r\\nflowers on the sides. The two front corners had canariensis in them.\\r\\nCanariensis is a pretty creeper with golden blossoms, very dainty and\\r\\nbright. And then, in little square patches all round the garden, were\\r\\nplanted London pride, blue bachelor\\'s buttons, yellow marigolds, tall\\r\\nlarkspur, many-coloured asters, hollyhocks stocks. All these lovely\\r\\nflowers used to grow in our grandmothers\\' gardens, if you don\\'t know\\r\\nwhat they look like, I hope you can find out next summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the flowers the middle path went the seeds for that\\r\\nwonderful salad garden; all the things Mrs Brown had named to Margery\\r\\nwere there. Margery had never seen anything more wonderful than the\\r\\nlittle round lettuce-seeds. They were so tiny that it did not seem\\r\\npossible that green lettuce leaves could come from them. But they surely\\r\\nwould.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother father Margery were late to supper that evening. But they\\r\\nwere all so happy that it did not matter. The last thing Margery\\r\\nthought of, as she went to sleep at night, was the dear, smooth little\\r\\ngarden, with its funny footpath, with the little sticks standing at\\r\\nthe ends of the rows, labelled \"lettuce,\" \"beets,\" \"helianthus,\" so\\r\\non.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a garden! I have a garden!\" was Margery\\'s last thought as she\\r\\nwent off to dreamland.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LITTLE COTYLEDONS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is another story about Margery\\'s garden.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning after the garden was planted, Margery was up out at\\r\\nsix o\\'clock. She could not wait to look at her garden. To be sure, she\\r\\nknew that the seeds could not sprout in a single night, but she had a\\r\\nfeeling that _something_ might happen at any moment. The garden was just\\r\\nas smooth brown as the night before, no little seedlings were in\\r\\nsight.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a very few mornings after that, when Margery went out, she saw a\\r\\nfunny little crack opening up through the earth, the whole length of the\\r\\npatch. Quickly she knelt down on the footpath, to see. Yes! Tiny green\\r\\nleaves, a whole row of them, were pushing their way through the crust!\\r\\nMargery knew what she had put there: it was the radish-row; these must\\r\\nbe radish leaves. She examined them very closely, so that she might\\r\\nknow a radish next time. The little leaves, no bigger than half your\\r\\nlittle-finger nail, grew in twos,--two on each tiny stem; they were\\r\\nalmost round.\\r\\n\\r\\nMargery flew back to her mother, to say that the first seeds were up.\\r\\nAnd her mother, nearly as excited as Margery, came to look at the little\\r\\ncrack.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach day, after that, the row of radishes grew, till, in a week, it\\r\\nstood as high as your finger, green sturdy. But about the third day,\\r\\nwhile Margery was stooping over the radishes, she saw something very,\\r\\nvery small green, peeping above ground, where the lettuce was\\r\\nplanted. Could it be weeds? No, for on looking very closely she saw that\\r\\nthe wee leaves faintly marked a regular row. They did not make a crack,\\r\\nlike the radishes; they seemed too small too far apart to push the\\r\\nearth up like that. Margery leaned down looked with all her eyes at\\r\\nthe baby plants. The tiny leaves grew two on a stem, were almost\\r\\nround. The more she looked at them the more it seemed to Margery that\\r\\nthey looked exactly as the radish looked when it first came up. \"Do you\\r\\nsuppose,\" Margery said to herself, \"that lettuce radish look alike\\r\\nwhile they are growing? They don\\'t look alike when they are on the\\r\\ntable!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDay by day the lettuce grew, soon the little round leaves were\\r\\neasier to examine; they certainly were very much like radish leaves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, one morning, while she was searching for signs of other seeds,\\r\\nMargery discovered the beets. In irregular patches on the row, hints of\\r\\ngreen were coming. The next day the next they grew, until the beet\\r\\nleaves were big enough to see.\\r\\n\\r\\nMargery looked. Then she looked again. Then she wrinkled her forehead.\\r\\n\"Can we have made a mistake?\" she thought. \"Do you suppose we can have\\r\\nplanted _all_ radishes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor those little beet leaves were almost round, they grew two on a\\r\\nstem, precisely like the lettuce the radish; except for the size,\\r\\nall three rows looked alike.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was too much for Margery. She ran to the house found her father.\\r\\nHer little face was so anxious that he thought something unpleasant had\\r\\nhappened. \"Papa,\" she said, all out of breath, \"do you think we could\\r\\nhave made a mistake about my garden? Do you think we could have put\\r\\nradishes in all the rows?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFather laughed. \"What makes you think such a thing?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Papa,\" said Margery, \"the little leaves all look exactly alike! every\\r\\nplant has just two tiny leaves on it, shaped the same; they are\\r\\nroundish, grow out of the stem at the same place.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPapa\\'s eyes began to twinkle. \"Many of the dicotyledonous plants look\\r\\nalike at the beginning,\" he said, with a little drawl on the big word.\\r\\nThat was to tease Margery, because she always wanted to know the big\\r\\nwords she heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s \\'dicotyledonous\\'?\" said Margery, carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait till I come home to-night, dear,\" said her father, \"I\\'ll tell\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat evening Margery was waiting eagerly for him. When her father\\r\\nfinished his supper they went together to the garden, father\\r\\nexamined the seedlings carefully. Then he pulled up a little radish\\r\\nplant a tiny beet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These little leaves,\" he said, \"are not the real leaves of the plant;\\r\\nthey are only little pockets to hold food for the plant to live on till\\r\\nit gets strong enough to push up into the air. As soon as the real\\r\\nleaves come out begin to draw food from the air, these little\\r\\nsubstitutes wither up fall off. These two lie folded up in the\\r\\nlittle seed from the beginning, are full of plant food. They don\\'t\\r\\nhave to be very special in shape, you see, because they don\\'t stay on\\r\\nthe plant after it is grown up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then every plant looks like this at first?\" said Margery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, dear, not every one; plants are divided into two kinds: those which\\r\\nhave two food leaves, like these plants, those which have only one;\\r\\nthese are called dicotyledonous, the ones which have but one food\\r\\nleaf are monocotyledonous. Many of the dicotyledons look alike.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think that is interesting,\" said Margery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I always, supposed the plants were different from the minute they began\\r\\nto grow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, no,\" said father. \"Even some of the trees look like this when\\r\\nthey first come through; you would not think a birch tree could look\\r\\nlike a vegetable or a flower, would you? But it does, at first; it looks\\r\\nso much like these things that in the great nurseries, where trees are\\r\\nraised for forests parks, the workmen have to be very carefully\\r\\ntrained, or else they would pull up the trees when they are weeding.\\r\\nThey have to be taught the difference between a birch tree a weed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How funny!\" said Margery, dimpling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it sounds funny,\" said father; \"but, you see, the birch tree is\\r\\ndicotyledonous, so are many weeds, the dicotyledons look so much\\r\\nalike at first.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am glad to know that, father,\" said Margery, soberly. \"I believe I\\r\\nshall learn a good deal from living in the country; don\\'t you think so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMargery\\'s father took her in his arms. \"I hope so, dear,\" he said; \"the\\r\\ncountry is a good place for little girls.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that was all that happened, that day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TALKATIVE TORTOISE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time, a Tortoise lived in a pond with two Ducks, who were\\r\\nher very good friends. She enjoyed the company of the Ducks, because she\\r\\ncould talk with them to her heart\\'s content; the Tortoise liked to talk.\\r\\nShe always had something to say, she liked to hear herself say it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter many years of this pleasant living, the pond became very low, in a\\r\\ndry season; finally it dried up. The two Ducks saw that they could\\r\\nno longer live there, so they decided to fly to another region, where\\r\\nthere was more water. They went to the Tortoise to bid her good-bye.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, don\\'t leave me behind!\" begged the Tortoise. \"Take me with you; I\\r\\nmust die if I am left here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you cannot fly!\" said the Ducks. \"How can we take you with us?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take me with you! take me with you!\" said the Tortoise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ducks felt so sorry for her that at last they thought of a way to\\r\\ntake her. \"We have thought of a way which will be possible,\" they said,\\r\\n\"if only you can manage to keep still long enough. We will each take\\r\\nhold of one end of a stout stick, do you take the middle in your\\r\\nmouth; then we will fly up in the air with you carry you with us.\\r\\nBut remember not to talk! If you open your mouth, you are lost.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tortoise said she would not say a word; she would not so much as\\r\\nmove her mouth; she was very grateful. So the Ducks brought a strong\\r\\nlittle stick took hold of the ends, while the Tortoise bit firmly on\\r\\nthe middle. Then the two Ducks rose slowly in the air flew away with\\r\\ntheir burden.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were above the treetops, the Tortoise wanted to say, \"How high\\r\\nwe are!\" But she remembered, kept still. When they passed the church\\r\\nsteeple she wanted to say, \"What is that which shines?\" But she\\r\\nremembered, held her peace. Then they came over the village square,\\r\\nthe people looked up saw them. \"Look at the Ducks carrying a\\r\\nTortoise!\" they shouted; every one ran to look. The Tortoise wanted\\r\\nto say, \"What business is it of yours?\" But she didn\\'t. Then she heard\\r\\nthe people shout, \"Isn\\'t it strange! Look at it! Look!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tortoise forgot everything except that she wanted to say, \"Hush, you\\r\\nfoolish people!\" She opened her mouth,--fell to the ground. And that\\r\\nwas the end of the Tortoise.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a very good thing to be able to hold one\\'s tongue!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nROBERT OF SICILY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn old legend says that there was once a king named Robert of Sicily,\\r\\nwho was brother to the Great Pope of Rome to the Emperor of\\r\\nAllemaine. He was a very selfish king, very proud; he cared more for\\r\\nhis pleasures than for the needs of his people, his heart was so\\r\\nfilled with his own greatness that he had no thought for God.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, this proud king was sitting in his place at church, at vesper\\r\\nservice; his courtiers were about him, in their bright garments, he\\r\\nhimself was dressed in his royal robes. The choir was chanting the Latin\\r\\nservice, as the beautiful voices swelled louder, the king noticed\\r\\none particular verse which seemed to be repeated again again. He\\r\\nturned to a learned clerk at his side asked what those words meant,\\r\\nfor he knew no Latin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They mean, \\'He hath put down the mighty from their seats, hath\\r\\nexalted them of low degree,\\'\" answered the clerk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is well the words are in Latin, then,\" said the king angrily, \"for\\r\\nthey are a lie. There is no power on earth or in heaven which can put me\\r\\ndown from my seat!\" he sneered at the beautiful singing, as he\\r\\nleaned back in his place.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently the king fell asleep, while the service went on. He slept\\r\\ndeeply long. When he awoke the church was dark still, he was\\r\\nall alone. He, the king, had been left alone in the church, to awake in\\r\\nthe dark! He was furious with rage surprise, and, stumbling through\\r\\nthe dim aisles, he reached the great doors beat at them, madly,\\r\\nshouting for his servants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old sexton heard some one shouting pounding in the church, and\\r\\nthought it was some drunken vagabond who had stolen in during the\\r\\nservice. He came to the door with his keys called out, \"Who is\\r\\nthere?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Open! open! It is I, the king!\" came a hoarse, angry voice from within.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a crazy man,\" thought the sexton; he was frightened. He\\r\\nopened the doors carefully stood back, peering into the darkness.\\r\\nOut past him rushed the figure of a man in tattered, scanty clothes,\\r\\nwith unkempt hair white, wild face. The sexton did not know that he\\r\\nhad ever seen him before, but he looked long after him, wondering at his\\r\\nwildness his haste.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his fluttering rags, without hat or cloak, not knowing what strange\\r\\nthing had happened to him, King Robert rushed to his palace gates,\\r\\npushed aside the startled servants, hurried, blind with rage, up the\\r\\nwide stair through the great corridors, toward the room where he\\r\\ncould hear the sound of his courtiers\\' voices. Men women servants\\r\\ntried to stop the ragged man, who had somehow got into the palace, but\\r\\nRobert did not even see them as he fled along. Straight to the open\\r\\ndoors of the big banquet hall he made his way, into the midst of the\\r\\ngrfeast there.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great hall was filled with lights flowers; the tables were set\\r\\nwith everything that is delicate rich to eat; the courtiers, in\\r\\ntheir gay clothes, were laughing talking; at the head of the\\r\\nfeast, on the king\\'s own throne, sat a king. His face, his figure, his\\r\\nvoice were exactly like Robert of Sicily; no human being could have told\\r\\nthe difference; no one dreamed that he was not the king. He was dressed\\r\\nin the king\\'s royal robes, he wore the royal crown, on his hwas\\r\\nthe king\\'s own ring. Robert of Sicily, half naked, ragged, without a\\r\\nsign of his kingship on him, stood before the throne stared with\\r\\nfury at this figure of himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king on the throne looked at him. \"Who art thou, what dost thou\\r\\nhere?\" he asked. And though his voice was just like Robert\\'s own, it had\\r\\nsomething in it sweet deep, like the sound of bells.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am the king!\" cried Robert of Sicily. \"I am the king, you are an\\r\\nimpostor!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe courtiers started from their seats, drew their swords. They\\r\\nwould have killed the crazy man who insulted their king; but he raised\\r\\nhis hstopped them, with his eyes looking into Robert\\'s eyes\\r\\nhe said, \"Not the king; you shall be the king\\'s jester! You shall wear\\r\\nthe cap bells, make laughter for my court. You shall be the\\r\\nservant of the servants, your companion shall, be the jester\\'s ape.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith shouts of laughter, the courtiers drove Robert of Sicily from the\\r\\nbanquet hall; the waiting-men, with laughter, too, pushed him into the\\r\\nsoldiers\\' hall; there the pages brought the jester\\'s wretched ape,\\r\\nput a fool\\'s cap bells on Robert\\'s head. It was like a terrible\\r\\ndream; he could not believe it true, he could not understwhat had\\r\\nhappened to him. And when he woke next morning, he believed it was a\\r\\ndream, that he was king again. But as he turned his head, he felt\\r\\nthe coarse straw under his cheek instead of the soft pillow, he saw\\r\\nthat he was in the stable, with the shivering ape by his side. Robert of\\r\\nSicily was a jester, no one knew him for the king.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree long years passed. Sicily was happy all things went well under\\r\\nthe king, who was not Robert. Robert was still the jester, his heart\\r\\ngrew harder more bitter with every year. Many times, during the\\r\\nthree years, the king, who had his face voice, had called him to\\r\\nhimself, when none else could hear, had asked him the one question,\\r\\n\"Who art thou?\" And each time that he asked it his eyes looked into\\r\\nRobert\\'s eyes, to find his heart. But each time Robert threw back his\\r\\nhead answered, proudly, \"I am the king!\" And the other king\\'s eyes\\r\\ngrew sad stern.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of three years, the Pope called the Emperor of Allemaine and\\r\\nthe King of Sicily, his brothers, to a great meeting in his city of\\r\\nRome. The King of Sicily went, with all his soldiers courtiers and\\r\\nservants,--a great procession of horsemen footmen. Never had there\\r\\nbeen seen a finer sight than the grtrain, men in bright armour,\\r\\nriders in wonderful cloaks of velvet silk, servants, carrying\\r\\nmarvellous presents to the Pope. And at the very end rode Robert, the\\r\\njester. His horse was poor old, many-coloured, the ape rode with\\r\\nhim. Every one in the villages through which they passed ran after the\\r\\njester, pointed laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pope received his brothers their trains in the square before\\r\\nSaint Peter\\'s. With music flags flowers he made the King of\\r\\nSicily welcome, greeted him as his brother. In the midst of it, the\\r\\njester broke through the crowd threw himself before the Pope. \"Look\\r\\nat me!\" he cried; \"I am your brother, Robert of Sicily! This man is an\\r\\nimpostor, who has stolen my throne. I am Robert, the king!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pope looked at the poor jester with pity, but the Emperor of\\r\\nAllemaine turned to the King of Sicily, said, \"Is it not rather\\r\\ndangerous, brother, to keep a madman as jester?\" And again Robert was\\r\\npushed back among the serving-men.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Holy Week, the king the emperor, with all their trains,\\r\\nwent every day to the great services in the cathedral. Something\\r\\nwonderful holy seemed to make these services more beautiful than\\r\\never before. All the people of Rome felt it: it was as if the presence\\r\\nof an angel were there. Men thought of God, felt His blessing on\\r\\nthem. But no one knew who it was that brought the beautiful feeling. And\\r\\nwhen Easter Day came, never had there been so lovely, so holy a day: in\\r\\nthe great churches, filled with flowers, sweet with incense, the\\r\\nkneeling people listened to the choirs singing, it was like the\\r\\nvoices of angels; their prayers were more earnest than ever before,\\r\\ntheir praise more glad; there was something heavenly in Rome.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert of Sicily went to the services with the rest, sat in the\\r\\nhumblest place with the servants. Over over again he heard the\\r\\nsweet voices of the choirs chant the Latin words he had heard long ago:\\r\\n_He hath put down the mighty from their seat, hath exalted them of\\r\\nlow degree_. And at last, as he listened, his heart was softened. He,\\r\\ntoo, felt the strange blessed presence of a heavenly power. He thought\\r\\nof God, of his own wickedness; he remembered how selfish he had\\r\\nbeen, how little good he had done; he realised, that his power had\\r\\nnot been from himself, at all. On Easter night, as he crept to his bed\\r\\nof straw, he wept, not because he was so wretched, but because he had\\r\\nnot been a better king when power was his.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last all the festivities were over, the King of Sicily went home\\r\\nto his own lagain, with his people. Robert the jester came home too.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the day of their home-coming, there was a special service in the\\r\\nroyal church, even after the service was over for the people, the\\r\\nmonks held prayers of thanksgiving praise. The sound of their\\r\\nsinging came softly in at the palace windows. In the great banquet room,\\r\\nthe king sat, wearing his royal robes his crown, while many subjects\\r\\ncame to greet him. At last, he sent them all away, saying he wanted to\\r\\nbe alone; but he commanded the jester to stay. And when they were alone\\r\\ntogether the king looked into Robert\\'s eyes, as he had done before, and\\r\\nsaid, softly, \"Who art thou?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert of Sicily bowed his head. \"Thou knowest best,\" he said, \"I only\\r\\nknow that I have sinned.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke, he heard the voices of the monks singing, _He hath put down\\r\\nthe mighty from their seat_,--his head sank lower. But suddenly the\\r\\nmusic seemed to change; a wonderful light shone all about. As Robert\\r\\nraised his eyes, he saw the face of the king smiling at him with a\\r\\nradiance like nothing on earth, as he sank to his knees before the\\r\\nglory of that smile, a voice sounded with the music, like a melody\\r\\nthrobbing on a single string,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am an angel, thou art the king!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Robert of Sicily was alone. His royal robes were upon him once\\r\\nmore; he wore his crown his royal ring. He was king. And when the\\r\\ncourtiers came back they found their king kneeling by his throne,\\r\\nabsorbed in silent prayer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE JEALOUS COURTIERS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI wonder if you have ever heard the anecdote about the artist of\\r\\nDuesseldorf the jealous courtiers. This is it. It seems there was\\r\\nonce a very famous artist who lived in the little town of Duesseldorf. He\\r\\ndid such fine work that the Elector, Prince Johann Wilhelm, ordered a\\r\\nportrait statue of himself, on horseback, to be done in bronze. The\\r\\nartist was overjoyed at the commission, worked early late at the\\r\\nstatue.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the work was done, the artist had the great statue set up in\\r\\nthe public square of Duesseldorf, ready for the opening view. The Elector\\r\\ncame on the appointed day, with him came his favourite courtiers\\r\\nfrom the castle. Then the statue was unveiled. It was very\\r\\nbeautiful,--so beautiful that the prince exclaimed in surprise. He could\\r\\nnot look enough, presently he turned to the artist shook hands\\r\\nwith him, like an old friend. \"Herr Grupello,\" he said, \"you are a great\\r\\nartist, this statue will make your fame even greater than it is; the\\r\\nportrait of me is perfect!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the courtiers heard this, saw the friendly hand-shake, their\\r\\njealousy of the artist was beyond bounds. Their one thought was, how\\r\\ncould they safely do something to humiliate him. They dared not pick\\r\\nflaws in the portrait statue, for the prince had declared it perfect.\\r\\nBut at last one of them said, with an air of great frankness, \"Indeed,\\r\\nHerr Grupello, the portrait of his Royal Highness is perfect; but permit\\r\\nme to say that the statue of the horse is not quite so successful: the\\r\\nhead is too large; it is out of proportion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said another, \"the horse is really not so successful; the turn of\\r\\nthe neck, there, is awkward.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you would change the right hind-foot, Herr Grupello,\" said a third,\\r\\n\"it would be an improvement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStill another found fault with the horse\\'s tail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe artist listened, quietly. When they had all finished, he turned to\\r\\nthe prince said, \"Your courtiers, prince, find a good many flaws in\\r\\nthe statue of the horse; will you permit me to keep it a few days more,\\r\\nto do what I can with it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Elector assented, the artist ordered a temporary screen to be\\r\\nbuilt around the statue, so that his assistants could work undisturbed.\\r\\nFor several days the sound of hammering came steadily from behind the\\r\\nenclosure. The courtiers, who took care to pass that way, often, were\\r\\ndelighted. Each one said to himself, \"I must have been right, really;\\r\\nthe artist himself sees that something was wrong; now I shall have\\r\\ncredit for saving the prince\\'s portrait by my artistic taste!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more the artist summoned the prince his courtiers, once\\r\\nmore the statue was unveiled. Again the Elector exclaimed at its beauty,\\r\\nthen he turned to his courtiers, one after another, to see what they\\r\\nhad to say.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perfect!\" said the first. \"Now that the horse\\'s head is in proportion,\\r\\nthere is not a flaw.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The change in the neck was just what was needed,\" said the second; \"it\\r\\nis very graceful now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The rear right foot is as it should be, now,\" said a third, \"it\\r\\nadds so much to the beauty of the whole!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth said that he considered the tail greatly improved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My courtiers are much pleased now,\" said the prince to Herr Grupello;\\r\\n\"they think the statue much improved by the changes you have made.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHerr Grupello smiled a little. \"I am glad they are pleased,\" he said,\\r\\n\"but the fact is, I have changed nothing!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\" said the prince in surprise. \"Have we not heard the\\r\\nsound of hammering every day? What were you hammering at then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was hammering at the reputation of your courtiers, who found fault\\r\\nsimply because they were jealous,\" said the artist. \"And I rather think\\r\\nthat their reputation is pretty well hammered to pieces!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, indeed. The Elector laughed heartily, but the courtiers slunk\\r\\naway, one after another, without a word.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCE CHERRY\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once an old king, so wise kind true that the most\\r\\npowerful good fairy of his lvisited him asked him to name the\\r\\ndearest wish of his heart, that she might grant it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Surely you know it,\" said the good king; \"it is for my only son, Prince\\r\\nCherry; do for him whatever you would have done for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gladly,\" said the great fairy; \"choose what I shall give him. I can\\r\\nmake him the richest, the most beautiful, or the most powerful prince in\\r\\nthe world; choose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None of those things are what I want,\" said the king. \"I want only that\\r\\nhe shall be good. Of what use will it be to him to be beautiful, rich,\\r\\nor powerful, if he grows into a bad man? Make him the best prince in the\\r\\nworld, I beg you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Alas, I cannot make him good,\" said the fairy; \"he must do that for\\r\\nhimself. I can give him good advice, reprove him when he does wrong, and\\r\\npunish him if he will not punish himself; I can will be his best\\r\\nfriend, but I cannot make him good unless he wills it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king was sad to hear this, but he rejoiced in the friendship of the\\r\\nfairy for his son. And when he died, soon after, he was happy to know\\r\\nthat he left Prince Cherry in her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince Cherry grieved for his father, often lay awake at night,\\r\\nthinking of him. One night, when he was all alone in his room, a soft\\r\\nlovely light suddenly shone before him, a beautiful vision stood\\r\\nat his side. It was the good fairy. She was clad in robes of dazzling\\r\\nwhite, on her shining hair she wore a wreath of white roses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am the Fairy Candide,\" she said to the prince. \"I promised your\\r\\nfather that I would be your best friend, as long as you live I shall\\r\\nwatch over your happiness. I have brought you a gift; it is not\\r\\nwonderful to look at, but it has a wonderful power for your welfare;\\r\\nwear it, let it help you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke, she placed a small gold ring on the prince\\'s little\\r\\nfinger. \"This ring,\" she said, \"will help you to be good; when you do\\r\\nevil, it will prick you, to remind you. If you do not heed its warnings\\r\\na worse thing will happen to you, for I shall become your enemy.\" Then\\r\\nshe vanished.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince Cherry wore his ring, said nothing to anyone of the fairy\\'s\\r\\ngift. It did not prick him for a long time, because he was good and\\r\\nmerry happy. But Prince Cherry had been rather spoiled by his nurse\\r\\nwhen he was a child; she had always said to him that when he should\\r\\nbecome king he could do exactly as he pleased. Now, after a while, he\\r\\nbegan to find out that this was not true, it made him angry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first time that he noticed that even a king could not always have\\r\\nhis own way was on a day when he went hunting. It happened that he got\\r\\nno game. This put him in such a bad temper that he grumbled scolded\\r\\nall the way home. The little gold ring began to feel tight and\\r\\nuncomfortable. When he reached the palace his pet dog ran to meet him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go away!\" said the prince, crossly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the little dog was so used to being petted that he only jumped up on\\r\\nhis master, tried to kiss his hand. The prince turned kicked the\\r\\nlittle creature. At the instant, he felt a sharp prick in his little\\r\\nfinger, like a pin prick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What nonsense!\" said the prince to himself. \"Am I not king of the whole\\r\\nland? May I not kick my own dog, if I choose? What evil is there in\\r\\nthat?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA silver voice spoke in his ear: \"The king of the lhas a right to do\\r\\ngood, but not evil; you have been guilty of bad temper of cruelty\\r\\nto-day; see that you do better to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince turned sharply, but no one was to be seen; yet he recognised\\r\\nthe voice as that of Fairy Candide.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe followed her advice for a little, but presently he forgot, the\\r\\nring pricked him so sharply that his finger had a drop of blood on it.\\r\\nThis happened again again, for the prince grew more self-willed and\\r\\nheadstrong every day; he had some bad friends, too, who urged him on, in\\r\\nthe hope that he would ruin himself give them a chance to seize the\\r\\nthrone. He treated his people carelessly his servants cruelly, and\\r\\neverything he wanted he felt that he must have.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ring annoyed him terribly; it was embarrassing for a king to have a\\r\\ndrop of blood on his finger all the time! At last he took the ring off\\r\\nput it out of sight. Then he thought he should be perfectly happy,\\r\\nhaving his own way; but instead, he grew more unhappy as he grew less\\r\\ngood. Whenever he was crossed, or could not have his own way instantly,\\r\\nhe flew into a passion.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, he wanted something that he really could not have. This time it\\r\\nwas a most beautiful young girl, named Zelia; the prince saw her, and\\r\\nloved her so much that he wanted at once to make her his queen. To his\\r\\ngreat astonishment, she refused.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Am I not pleasing to you?\" asked the prince in surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very handsome, very charming, prince,\" said Zelia; \"but you are\\r\\nnot like the good king, your father; I fear you would make me very\\r\\nmiserable if I were your queen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a great rage, Prince Cherry ordered the young girl to be put in\\r\\nprison; the key of her dungeon he kept. He told one of his friends,\\r\\na wicked man who flattered him for his own purposes, about the thing,\\r\\nasked his advice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you not king?\" said the bad friend. \"May you not do as you will?\\r\\nKeep the girl in a dungeon till she does as you command, if she will\\r\\nnot, sell her as a slave.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But would it not be a disgrace for me to harm an innocent creature?\"\\r\\nsaid the prince.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would be a disgrace to you to have it said that one of your subjects\\r\\ndared disobey you!\" said the courtier.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had cleverly touched the prince\\'s worst trait, his pride. Prince\\r\\nCherry went at once to Zelia\\'s dungeon, prepared to do this cruel thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nZelia was gone. No one had the key save the prince himself; yet she was\\r\\ngone. The only person who could have dared to help her, thought the\\r\\nprince, was his old tutor, Suliman, the only man left who ever rebuked\\r\\nhim for anything. In fury, he ordered Suliman to be put in fetters and\\r\\nbrought before him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs his servants left him, to carry out the wicked order, there was a\\r\\nclash, as of thunder, in the room, then a blinding light. Fairy\\r\\nCandide stood before him. Her beautiful face was stern, her silver\\r\\nvoice rang like a trumpet, as she said, \"Wicked selfish prince, you\\r\\nhave become baser than the beasts you hunt; you are furious as a lion,\\r\\nrevengeful as a serpent, greedy as a wolf, brutal as a bull; take,\\r\\ntherefore, the shape of those beasts whom you resemble!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith horror, the prince felt himself being transformed into a monster.\\r\\nHe tried to rush upon the fairy kill her, but she had vanished with\\r\\nher words. As he stood, her voice came from the air, saying, sadly,\\r\\n\"Learn to conquer your pride by being in submission to your own\\r\\nsubjects.\" At the same moment, Prince Cherry felt himself being\\r\\ntransported to a distant forest, where he was set down by a clear\\r\\nstream. In the water he saw his own terrible image; he had the head of a\\r\\nlion, with bull\\'s horns, the feet of a wolf, a tail like a serpent.\\r\\nAnd as he gazed in horror, the fairy\\'s voice whispered, \"Your soul has\\r\\nbecome more ugly than your shape is; you yourself have deformed it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor beast rushed away from the sound of her words, but in a moment\\r\\nhe stumbled into a trap, set by bear-catchers. When the trappers found\\r\\nhim they were delighted to have caught a curiosity, they immediately\\r\\ndragged him to the palace courtyard. There he heard the whole court\\r\\nbuzzing with gossip. Prince Cherry had been struck by lightning and\\r\\nkilled, was the news, the five favourite courtiers had struggled to\\r\\nmake themselves rulers, but the people had refused them, offered the\\r\\ncrown to Suliman, the good old tutor.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven as he heard this, the prince saw Suliman on the steps of the\\r\\npalace, speaking to the people. \"I will take the crown to keep in\\r\\ntrust,\" he said. \"Perhaps the prince is not dead.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He was a bad king; we do not want him back,\" said the people.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know his heart,\" said Suliman, \"it is not all bad; it is tainted, but\\r\\nnot corrupt; perhaps he will repent come back to us a good king.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the beast heard this, it touched him so much that he stopped\\r\\ntearing at his chains, became gentle. He let his keepers lead him\\r\\naway to the royal menagerie without hurting them.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife was very terrible to the prince, now, but he began to see that he\\r\\nhad brought all his sorrow on himself, he tried to bear it\\r\\npatiently. The worst to bear was the cruelty of the keeper. At last, one\\r\\nnight, this keeper was in great danger; a tiger got loose, attacked\\r\\nhim. \"Good enough! Let him die!\" thought Prince Cherry. But when he saw\\r\\nhow helpless the keeper was, he repented, sprang to help. He killed\\r\\nthe tiger saved the keeper\\'s life.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he crouched at the keeper\\'s feet, a voice said, \"Good actions never\\r\\ngo unrewarded!\" And the terrible monster was changed into a pretty\\r\\nlittle white dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe keeper carried the beautiful little dog to the court told the\\r\\nstory, from then on, Cherry was carefully treated, had the best\\r\\nof everything. But in order to keep the little dog from growing, the\\r\\nqueen ordered that he should be fed very little, that was pretty\\r\\nhard for the poor prince. He was often half starved, although so much\\r\\npetted.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day he had carried his crust of bread to a retired spot in the\\r\\npalace woods, where he loved to be, when he saw a poor old woman hunting\\r\\nfor roots, seeming almost starved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor thing,\" he thought, \"she is even more hungry than I\"; he ran\\r\\nup dropped the crust at her feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman ate it, seemed greatly refreshed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCherry was glad of that, he was running happily back to his kennel\\r\\nwhen he heard cries of distress, suddenly he saw some rough men\\r\\ndragging along a young girl, who was weeping crying for help. What\\r\\nwas his horror to see that the young girl was Zelia! Oh, how he wished\\r\\nhe were the monster once more, so that he could kill the men rescue\\r\\nher! But he could do nothing except bark, bite at the heels of the\\r\\nwicked men. That did not stop them; they drove him off, with blows, and\\r\\ncarried Zelia into a palace in the wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Cherry crouched by the steps, watched. His heart was full of\\r\\npity rage. But suddenly he thought, \"I was as bad as these men; I\\r\\nmyself put Zelia in prison, would have treated her worse still, if I\\r\\nhad not been prevented.\" The thought made him so sorry ashamed that\\r\\nhe repented bitterly the evil he had done.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently a window opened, Cherry saw Zelia lean out throw down\\r\\na piece of meat. He seized it was just going to devour it, when the\\r\\nold woman to whom he had given his crust snatched it away took him\\r\\nin her arms. \"No, you shall not eat it, you poor little thing,\" she\\r\\nsaid, \"for every bit of food in that house is poisoned.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same moment, a voice said, \"Good actions never go unrewarded!\"\\r\\nAnd instantly Prince Cherry was transformed into a little white dove.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith great joy, he flew to the open palace window to seek out his Zelia,\\r\\nto try to help her. But though he hunted in every room, no Zelia was to\\r\\nbe found. He had to fly away, without seeing her. He wanted more than\\r\\nanything else to find her, stay near her, so he flew out into the\\r\\nworld, to seek her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sought her in many lands, until one day, in a far eastern country, he\\r\\nfound her sitting in a tent, by the side of an old, white-haired hermit.\\r\\nCherry was wild with delight. He flew to her shoulder, caressed her hair\\r\\nwith his beak, cooed in her ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You dear, lovely little thing!\" said Zelia. \"Will you stay with me? If\\r\\nyou will, I will love you always.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, Zelia, see what you have done!\" laughed the hermit. At that\\r\\ninstant, the white dove vanished, Prince Cherry stood there, as\\r\\nhandsome charming as ever, with a look of kindness modesty\\r\\nin his eyes which had never been there before. At the same time, the\\r\\nhermit stood up, his flowing hair changed to shining gold, his face\\r\\nbecame a lovely woman\\'s face; it was the Fairy Candide. \"Zelia has\\r\\nbroken your spell,\" she said to the prince, \"as I meant she should, when\\r\\nyou were worthy of her love.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nZelia Prince Cherry fell at the fairy\\'s feet. But with a beautiful\\r\\nsmile she bade them come to their kingdom. In a trice, they were\\r\\ntransported to the prince\\'s palace, where King Suliman greeted them with\\r\\ntears of joy. He gave back the throne with all his heart, King\\r\\nCherry ruled again, with Zelia for his queen.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wore the little gold ring all the rest of his life, but never once\\r\\ndid it have to prick him hard enough to make his finger bleed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GOLD IN THE ORCHARD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a farmer who had a fine olive orchard. He was very\\r\\nindustrious, the farm always prospered under his care. But he knew\\r\\nthat his three sons despised the farm work, were eager to make\\r\\nwealth fast, through adventure.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the farmer was old, felt that his time had come to die, he\\r\\ncalled the three sons to him said, \"My sons, there is a pot of gold\\r\\nhidden in the olive orchard. Dig for it, if you wish it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sons tried to get him to tell them in what part of the orchard the\\r\\ngold was hidden; but he would tell them nothing more.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the farmer was dead, the sons went to work to find the pot of\\r\\ngold; since they did not know where the hiding-place was, they agreed to\\r\\nbegin in a line, at one end of the orchard, to dig until one of them\\r\\nshould find the money.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey dug until they had turned up the soil from one end of the orchard\\r\\nto the other, round the tree-roots between them. But no pot of gold\\r\\nwas to be found. It seemed as if some one must have stolen it, or as if\\r\\nthe farmer had been wandering in his wits. The three sons were bitterly\\r\\ndisappointed to have all their work for nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next olive season, the olive trees in the orchard bore more fruit\\r\\nthan they had ever given before; the fine cultivating they had had from\\r\\nthe digging brought so much fruit, of so fine a quality, that when\\r\\nit was sold it gave the sons a whole pot of gold!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when they saw how much money had come from the orchard, they\\r\\nsuddenly understood what the wise father had meant when he said, \"There\\r\\nis gold hidden in the orchard; dig for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMARGARET OF NEW ORLEANS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you ever go to the beautiful city of New Orleans, somebody will be\\r\\nsure to take you down into the old business part of the city, where\\r\\nthere are banks shops hotels, show you a statue which stands\\r\\nin a little square there. It is the statue of a woman, sitting in a low\\r\\nchair, with her arms around a child, who leans against her. The woman is\\r\\nnot at all pretty: she wears thick, common shoes, a plain dress, with a\\r\\nlittle shawl, a sun-bonnet; she is stout short, her face is\\r\\na square-chinned Irish face; but her eyes look at you like your\\r\\nmother\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow there is something very surprising about this statue: it was the\\r\\nfirst one that was ever made in America in honour of a woman. Even in\\r\\nEurope there are not many monuments to women, most of the few are to\\r\\ngreat queens or princesses, very beautiful very richly dressed. You\\r\\nsee, this statue in New Orleans is not quite like anything else.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the statue of a woman named Margaret. Her whole name was Margaret\\r\\nHaughery, but no one in New Orleans remembers her by it, any more than\\r\\nyou think of your dearest sister by her full name; she is just Margaret.\\r\\nThis is her story, it tells why people made a monument for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Margaret was a tiny baby, her father mother died, she was\\r\\nadopted by two young people as poor as kind as her own parents. She\\r\\nlived with them until she grew up. Then she married, had a little\\r\\nbaby of her own. But very soon her husbdied, then the baby died,\\r\\ntoo, Margaret was all alone in the world. She was poor, but she was\\r\\nstrong, knew how to work.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll day, from morning until evening, she ironed clothes in a laundry.\\r\\nAnd every day, as she worked by the window, she saw the little\\r\\nmotherless children from the orphan asylum, near by, working and\\r\\nplaying about. After a while, there came a great sickness upon the city,\\r\\nso many mothers fathers died that there were more orphans than\\r\\nthe asylum could possibly take care of. They needed a good friend, now.\\r\\nYou would hardly think, would you, that a poor woman who worked in a\\r\\nlaundry could be much of a friend to them? But Margaret was. She went\\r\\nstraight to the kind Sisters who had the asylum told them she was\\r\\ngoing to give them part of her wages was going to work for them,\\r\\nbesides. Pretty soon she had worked so hard that she had some money\\r\\nsaved from her wages. With this, she bought two cows a little\\r\\ndelivery cart. Then she carried her milk to her customers in the little\\r\\ncart every morning; as she went, she begged the pieces of food left\\r\\nover from the hotels rich houses, brought it back in the cart to\\r\\nthe hungry children in the asylum. In the very hardest times that was\\r\\noften all the food the poor children had.\\r\\n\\r\\nA part of the money Margaret earned went every week to the asylum, and\\r\\nafter a few years that was made very much larger better. Margaret\\r\\nwas so careful so good at business that, in spite of her giving, she\\r\\nbought more cows earned more money. With this, she built a home for\\r\\norphan babies; she called it her baby house.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a time, Margaret had a chance to get a bakery, then she became\\r\\na bread-woman instead of a milk-woman. She carried the bread just as she\\r\\nhad carried the milk, in her cart. And still she kept giving money to\\r\\nthe asylum. Then the great war came, the Civil War. In all the trouble\\r\\nsickness fear of that time, Margaret drove her cart of bread;\\r\\nsomehow she had always enough to give the starving soldiers, for\\r\\nher babies, beside what she sold. And despite all this, she earned\\r\\nenough so that when the war was over she built a big steam factory for\\r\\nher bread. By this time everybody in the city knew her. The children all\\r\\nover the city loved her; the business men were proud of her; the poor\\r\\npeople all came to her for advice. She used to sit at the open door of\\r\\nher office, in a calico gown a little shawl, give a good word to\\r\\neverybody, rich or poor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, by by, one day, Margaret died. And when it was time to read\\r\\nher will, the people found that, with all her giving, she had still\\r\\nsaved a great deal of money, that she had left every penny of it to\\r\\nthe different orphan asylums of the city,--each one of them was given\\r\\nsomething. Whether they were for white children or black, for Jews,\\r\\nCatholics, or Protestants, made no difference; for Margaret always said,\\r\\n\"They are all orphans alike.\" And just think, dears, that splendid,\\r\\nwise will was signed with a cross instead of a name, for Margaret had\\r\\nnever learned to read or write!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the people of New Orleans knew that Margaret was dead, they said,\\r\\n\"She was a mother to the motherless; she was a friend to those who had\\r\\nno friends; she had wisdom greater than schools can teach; we will not\\r\\nlet her memory go from us.\" So they made a statue of her, just as she\\r\\nused to look, sitting in her own office door, or driving in her own\\r\\nlittle cart. And there it stands to-day, in memory of the great love and\\r\\nthe great power of plain Margaret Haughery, of New Orleans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DAGDA\\'S HARP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know, dears, in the old countries there are many fine stories about\\r\\nthings which happened so very long ago that nobody knows exactly how\\r\\nmuch of them is true. Irelis like that. It is so old that even as\\r\\nlong ago as four thousyears it had people who dug in the mines, and\\r\\nknew how to weave cloth to make beautiful ornaments out of gold, and\\r\\nwho could fight make laws; but we do not know just where they came\\r\\nfrom, nor exactly how they lived. These people left us some splendid\\r\\nstories about their kings, their fights, their beautiful women; but\\r\\nit all happened such a long time ago that the stories are mixtures of\\r\\nthings that really happened what people said about them, we\\r\\ndon\\'t know just which is which. The stories are called _legends_. One of\\r\\nthe prettiest legends is the story I am going to tell you about the\\r\\nDagda\\'s harp.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is said that there were two quite different kinds of people in\\r\\nIreland: one set of people with long dark hair dark eyes, called\\r\\nFomorians--they carried long slender spears made of golden bronze when\\r\\nthey fought--another race of people who were golden-haired and\\r\\nblue-eyed, who carried short, blunt, heavy spears of dull metal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe golden-haired people had a great chieftain who was also a kind of\\r\\nhigh priest, who was called the Dagda. And this Dagda had a wonderful\\r\\nmagic harp. The harp was beautiful to look upon, mighty in size, made of\\r\\nrare wood, ornamented with gold jewels; it had wonderful\\r\\nmusic in its strings, which only the Dagda could call out. When the men\\r\\nwere going out to battle, the Dagda would set up his magic harp and\\r\\nsweep his hacross the strings, a war song would ring out which\\r\\nwould make every warrior buckle on his armour, brace his knees, and\\r\\nshout, \"Forth to the fight!\" Then, when the men came back from the\\r\\nbattle, weary wounded, the Dagda would take his harp strike a\\r\\nfew chords, as the magic music stole out upon the air, every man\\r\\nforgot his weariness the smart of his wounds, thought of the\\r\\nhonour he had won, of the comrade who had died beside him, of\\r\\nthe safety of his wife children. Then the song would swell out\\r\\nlouder, every warrior would remember only the glory he had helped\\r\\nwin for the king; each man would rise at the great table, his cup in\\r\\nhis hand, shout \"Long live the King!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere came a time when the Fomorians the golden-haired men were at\\r\\nwar; in the midst of a great battle, while the Dagda\\'s hall was not\\r\\nso well guarded as usual, some of the chieftains of the Fomorians stole\\r\\nthe great harp from the wall, where it hung, fled away with it.\\r\\nTheir wives children some few of their soldiers went with them,\\r\\nthey fled fast far through the night, until they were a long way\\r\\nfrom the battlefield. Then they thought they were safe, they turned\\r\\naside into a vacant castle, by the road, sat down to a banquet,\\r\\nhanging the stolen harp on the wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dagda, with two or three of his warriors, had followed hard on their\\r\\ntrack. And while they were in the midst of their banqueting, the door\\r\\nwas suddenly burst open, the Dagda stood there, with his men. Some\\r\\nof the Fomorians sprang to their feet, but before any of them could\\r\\ngrasp a weapon, the Dagda called out to his harp on the wall, \"Come to\\r\\nme, O my harp!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great harp recognised its master\\'s voice, leaped from the wall.\\r\\nWhirling through the hall, sweeping aside killing the men who got in\\r\\nits way, it sprang to its master\\'s hand. And the Dagda took his harp and\\r\\nswept his hacross the strings in three great, solemn chords. The\\r\\nharp answered with the magic Music of Tears. As the wailing harmony\\r\\nsmote upon the air, the women of the Fomorians bowed their heads and\\r\\nwept bitterly, the strong men turned their faces aside, the little\\r\\nchildren sobbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the Dagda touched the strings, this time the magic Music of\\r\\nMirth leaped from the harp. And when they heard that Music of Mirth, the\\r\\nyoung warriors of the Fomorians began to laugh; they laughed till the\\r\\ncups fell from their grasp, the spears dropped from their hands,\\r\\nwhile the wine flowed from the broken bowls; they laughed until their\\r\\nlimbs were helpless with excess of glee.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more the Dagda touched his harp, but very, very softly. And now a\\r\\nmusic stole forth as soft as dreams, as sweet as joy: it was the\\r\\nmagic Music of Sleep. When they heard that, gently, gently, the Fomorian\\r\\nwomen bowed their heads in slumber; the little children crept to their\\r\\nmothers\\' laps; the old men nodded; the young warriors drooped in\\r\\ntheir seats closed their eyes: one after another all the Fomorians\\r\\nsank into sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were all deep in slumber, the Dagda took his magic harp, and\\r\\nhe his golden-haired warriors stole softly away, came in safety\\r\\nto their own homes again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TAILOR AND THE THREE BEASTS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a tailor in Galway, he started out on a journey to go\\r\\nto the king\\'s court at Dublin.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had not gone far when he met a white horse, he saluted him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God save you,\" said the tailor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God save you,\" said the horse. \"Where are you going?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am going to Dublin,\" said the tailor, \"to build a court for the king\\r\\nto get a lady for a wife, if I am able to do it.\" For, it seems the\\r\\nking had promised his daughter a great lot of money to anyone who\\r\\nshould be able to build up his court. The trouble was, that three giants\\r\\nlived in the wood near the court, every night they came out of the\\r\\nwood threw down all that was built by day. So nobody could get the\\r\\ncourt built.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you make me a hole,\" said the old white garraun, \"where I could\\r\\ngo in to hide whenever the people come to fetch me to the mill or the\\r\\nkiln, so that they won\\'t see me; for they tire me out doing work for\\r\\nthem?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll do that, indeed,\" said the tailor, \"welcome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe brought his spade shovel, he made a hole, he asked the\\r\\nold white horse to go down into it so that he could see if it would fit\\r\\nhim. The white horse went down into the hole, but when he tried to come\\r\\nup again, he was not able.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Make a place for me now,\" said the white horse, \"by which I can come up\\r\\nout of the hole here, whenever I am hungry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not,\" said the tailor; \"remain where you are until I come back,\\r\\nI\\'ll lift you up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tailor went forward next day, the fox met him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God save you,\" said the fox.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God save you,\" said the tailor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where are you going?\" said the fox.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m going to Dublin, to try to make a court for the king.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you make a place for me where I can hide?\" said the fox. \"The\\r\\nrest of the foxes are always beating me, they will not allow me to\\r\\neat anything with them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll do that for you,\" said the tailor.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took his axe his saw, he made a thing like a crate, he\\r\\ntold the fox to get into it so that he could see whether it would fit\\r\\nhim. The fox went into it, when the tailor had him down, he shut him\\r\\nin. When the fox was satisfied at last that he had a nice place of it\\r\\nwithin, he asked the tailor to let him out, the tailor answered that\\r\\nhe would not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait there until I come back again,\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tailor went forward the next day, he had not walked very far\\r\\nwhen he met a lion; the lion greeted him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God save you,\" said the lion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God save you,\" said the tailor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where are you going?\" said the lion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m going to Dublin to make a court for the king if I am able to make\\r\\nit,\" said the tailor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you were to make a plough for me,\" said the lion, \"I the other\\r\\nlions could be ploughing harrowing until we\\'d have a bit to eat in\\r\\nthe harvest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll do that for you,\" said the tailor.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe brought his axe his saw, he made a plough. When the plough\\r\\nwas made he put a hole in the beam of it, got the lion to go in\\r\\nunder the plough so that he might see if he was any good as a\\r\\nploughman. He placed the lion\\'s tail in the hole he had made for it, and\\r\\nthen clapped in a peg, the lion was not able to draw out his tail\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Loose me now,\" said the lion, \"we\\'ll fix ourselves go\\r\\nploughing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tailor said he would not loose him until he came back himself. He\\r\\nleft him there then, he came to Dublin.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he arrived, he engaged workmen began to build the court. At the\\r\\nend of the day he had the workmen put a great stone on top of the work.\\r\\nWhen the great stone was raised up, the tailor put some sort of\\r\\ncontrivance under it, that he might be able to throw it down as soon as\\r\\nthe giants came near to it. The workpeople then went home, the\\r\\ntailor went in hiding behind the big stone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the darkness of the night was come, he saw the three giants\\r\\narriving, they began throwing down the court until they arrived at\\r\\nthe place where the tailor was in hiding up above, one of them\\r\\nstruck a blow with his sledge on the place where he was. The tailor\\r\\nthrew down the stone, it fell on him killed him. The other two\\r\\nwent home then left all of the court that was remaining without\\r\\nthrowing it down, since their companion was dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe workmen came again the next day, they were working until night,\\r\\nas they were going home the tailor told them to put up the big\\r\\nstone on the top of the work, as it had been the night before. They did\\r\\nthat for him, went home, the tailor went in hiding the same as he\\r\\ndid the evening before.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the people had all gone to rest, the two giants came, they were\\r\\nthrowing down all that was before them, but as soon as they began, the\\r\\ntailor commenced manoeuvring until he was able to throw down the great\\r\\nstone, so that it fell upon the skull of the giant that was under him,\\r\\nit killed him. After this there was only the one giant left, he\\r\\nnever came again until the court was finished.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen when the work was over, the tailor went to the king told him to\\r\\ngive him his wife his money, as he had the court finished; the\\r\\nking said he would not give him any wife until he had killed the other\\r\\ngiant, for he said that it was not by his strength he had killed the two\\r\\ngiants before, that he would give him nothing now until he killed\\r\\nthe other one for him. Then the tailor said that he would kill the other\\r\\ngiant for him, welcome; that there should be no delay at all about\\r\\nthat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tailor went then till he came to the place where the other giant\\r\\nwas, asked did he want a servant-boy. The giant said he did want\\r\\none, if he could get one who would do everything that he would do\\r\\nhimself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anything that you will do, I will do,\" said the tailor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went to their dinner then, when they had eaten it, the giant\\r\\nasked the tailor \"would he dare to swallow as much boiling broth as\\r\\nhimself.\" The tailor said, \"I will certainly do that, but you must give\\r\\nme an hour before we commence.\" The tailor went out then, he got a\\r\\nsheepskin, which he sewed up until he made a bag of it, he slipped\\r\\nit down under his coat. He came in then told the giant first to\\r\\ndrink a gallon of the broth himself. The giant drank that up while it\\r\\nwas boiling. \"I\\'ll do that,\" said the tailor. He went on until it was\\r\\nall poured into the skin, the giant thought he had drunk it. The\\r\\ngiant drank another gallon then, the tailor let another gallon down\\r\\ninto the skin, but the giant thought he was drinking it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll do a thing now that you will not dare to do,\" said the tailor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will not,\" said the giant. \"What is it you would do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Make a hole let out the broth again,\" said the tailor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do it yourself first,\" said the giant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tailor gave a prod of the knife, he let the broth out of the\\r\\nskin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now you do that,\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will,\" said the giant, giving such a prod of the knife into his own\\r\\nstomach that he killed himself. That is the way the tailor killed the\\r\\nthird giant.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went to the king then, desired him to send him out his wife and\\r\\nhis money, saying that he would throw down the court again if he did not\\r\\ndo so immediately. They were afraid then that he would throw down the\\r\\ncourt, they sent the wife to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the tailor was a day gone, himself his wife, they repented and\\r\\nfollowed him to take his wife away from him again. The people who went\\r\\nafter him followed him until they came to the place where the lion was,\\r\\nthe lion said to them, \"The tailor his wife were here yesterday.\\r\\nI saw them going by, if you will loose me now, I am swifter than\\r\\nyou, I will follow them until I overtake them.\" When they heard\\r\\nthat, they released the lion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lion the people of Dublin went on, pursued the tailor, until\\r\\nthey came to the place where the fox was, the fox greeted them, and\\r\\nsaid, \"The tailor his wife were here this morning, if you will\\r\\nloose me, I am swifter than you, I will follow them, overtake\\r\\nthem.\" They therefore set the fox free.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lion the fox the army of Dublin went on then, trying to\\r\\ncatch the tailor, they kept going until they came to the place\\r\\nwhere the old white garraun was, the old white garraun told them\\r\\nthat the tailor his wife were there in the morning, \"Loose me,\"\\r\\nsaid he; \"I am swifter than you, I\\'ll overtake them.\" They released\\r\\nthe old white garraun then, the old white garraun, the fox, the\\r\\nlion, the army of Dublin pursued the tailor his wife, it was\\r\\nnot long before they came up with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the tailor saw them coming, he got out of the coach with his wife,\\r\\nhe sat down on the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the old white garraun saw the tailor sitting on the ground, he\\r\\nsaid, \"That\\'s the position he was in when he made the hole for me, that\\r\\nI couldn\\'t get out of, when I went down into it. I\\'ll go no nearer to\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No!\" said the fox, \"but that\\'s the way he was when he was making the\\r\\nthing for me, I\\'ll go no nearer to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No!\" says the lion, \"but that\\'s the very way he had, when he was making\\r\\nthe plough that I was caught in. I\\'ll go no nearer to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all left him then returned. The tailor his wife came home\\r\\nto Galway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW THE SEA BECAME SALT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis story was told long ago by our Northern forefathers who brought it\\r\\nwith them in their dragon ships when they crossed the North Sea to\\r\\nsettle in England. In those days men were apt to invent stories to\\r\\naccount for things about them which seemed peculiar, loving the sea\\r\\nas they did, it is not strange that they had remarked the peculiarity of\\r\\nthe ocean water had found a reason why it is so different from the\\r\\nwater in the rivers steams.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not the only story that has come down to tell us how people of\\r\\nold accounted for the sea being salt. There are many such stories, each\\r\\ndifferent from the other, all showing that the same childlike spirit of\\r\\ninquiry was at work in different places, striving to find an answer to\\r\\nthis riddle of nature.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThere sprang from the sons of Odin a race of men who became mighty kings\\r\\nof the earth, one of these, named Frode, ruled over the lands that\\r\\nare called Denmark.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow about this time were found in Denmark two great millstones, so large\\r\\nthat no one had the strength to turn them. So Frode sent for all the\\r\\nwise men of the lbade them examine the stones tell him of\\r\\nwhat use they were, since no one could grind with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd after the wise men had looked closely at them read the magic\\r\\nletters which were cut upon their edge, they said that the millstones\\r\\nwere precious indeed, since they would grind out of nothing anything\\r\\nthat the miller might wish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo King Frode sent messengers over the world to find for him two\\r\\nservants who would be strong enough to grind with the millstones, and\\r\\nafter a long, long time his messengers found him two maid-servants, who\\r\\nwere bigger stronger than anyone in Denmark had ever seen. But no\\r\\none guessed that these were really Giant-Maidens who bore a grudge\\r\\nagainst all of the race of Odin.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirectly the Giant-Maidens were brought before Frode, before they\\r\\nhad rested after their long journey, or satisfied their hunger, he bade\\r\\nthem go to the mill, grind for him gold peace happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"They sang swung\\r\\n      The swift mill stone,\\r\\n      And with loud voice\\r\\n      They made their moan.\\r\\n      \\'We grind for Frode\\r\\n      Wealth gold\\r\\n      Abundant riches\\r\\n      He shall behold.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently Frode came into the mill to see that the new servants were\\r\\nperforming their task diligently. And as he watched them from the shadow\\r\\nby the door, the maidens stayed their grinding for a while to rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe greedy man could not bear to see even an instant\\'s pause, he\\r\\ncame out of the shadow, bade them, with harsh words, go on grinding,\\r\\ncease not except for so long as the cuckoo was silent, or while he\\r\\nhimself sang a song. Now it was early summer-time, the cuckoo was\\r\\ncalling all the day most of the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Giant-Maidens waxed very wroth with King Frode, as they\\r\\nresumed their labours they sang a song of the hardness of their lot in\\r\\nthe household of this pitiless King.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had been grinding out wealth happiness peace, but now they\\r\\nbade the magic stones to grind something very different.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently, as the great stones moved round round, Frode, who still\\r\\nstood by, heard one chant in a low, sing-song voice,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see a fire east of the town--the curlews awake sound a note of\\r\\nwarning. A host approaches in haste, to burn the dwelling of the king.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the next took up her song,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No longer will Frode sit on his throne, rule over rings of red gold\\r\\nmighty millstones. Now must we grind with all our might--and,\\r\\nbehold! red warriors come forth--revenge, bloodshed, ruin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Frode shook from head to foot in his terror, for he heard the tramp\\r\\nof a mighty host of warriors advancing from the sea. And as he looked\\r\\nfor a way of escape, the braces of the millstones broke with the strong\\r\\ngrinding, fell in two. And the whole world shook trembled with\\r\\nthe mighty shock of that breaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut through the crash din came the voices of the Giant-Maidens,\\r\\nloudly chanting,--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"We have turned the stone round;\\r\\n      Though weary the maidens,\\r\\n      See what they have ground!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that same night a mighty sea-king came up slew Frode and\\r\\nplundered his city.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had sacked the city, the sea-king took on board his ship the two\\r\\nGiant-Maidens, with them the broken millstones. And he bade them\\r\\nbegin at once to grind salt, for of this he had very scanty store.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they ground ground; in the middle of the night, being weary,\\r\\nthey asked the sea-king if he had not got salt enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the sea-king was hard of heart, like Frode, he roughly bade them\\r\\ngo on grinding. And the maidens did so, worked to such effect that\\r\\nwithin a short time the millstones had ground out so much salt that the\\r\\nweight of it began to sink the ship. Down, down it sank, ship giants\\r\\nmillstones, in that spot, in the very middle of the ocean, arose\\r\\na whirlpool, from whence the salt is carried north south, east and\\r\\nwest, throughout the waters of the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that is how the sea became salt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CASTLE OF FORTUNE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne lovely summer morning, just as the sun rose, two travellers started\\r\\non a journey. They were both strong young men, but one was a lazy fellow\\r\\nthe other was a worker.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the first sunbeams came over the hills, they shone on a great castle\\r\\nstanding on the heights, as far away as the eye could see. It was a\\r\\nwonderful beautiful castle, all glistening towers that gleamed like\\r\\nmarble, glancing windows that shone like crystal. The two young men\\r\\nlooked at it eagerly, longed to go nearer.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, out of the distance, something like a great butterfly, of\\r\\nwhite gold, swept toward them. And when it came nearer, they saw\\r\\nthat it was a most beautiful lady, robed in floating garments as fine as\\r\\ncobwebs wearing on her head a crown so bright that no one could tell\\r\\nwhether it was of diamonds or of dew. She stood, light as air, on a\\r\\ngreat, shining, golden ball, which rolled along with her, swifter than\\r\\nthe wind. As she passed the travellers, she turned her face to them and\\r\\nsmiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Follow me!\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lazy man sat down in the grass with a discontented sigh. \"She has\\r\\nan easy time of it!\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the industrious man ran after the lovely lady caught the hem of\\r\\nher floating robe in his grasp. \"Who are you, whither are you\\r\\ngoing?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am the Fairy of Fortune,\" the beautiful lady said, \"that is my\\r\\ncastle. You may reach it to-day, if you will; there is time, if you\\r\\nwaste none. If you reach it before the last stroke of midnight, I will\\r\\nreceive you there, will be your friend. But if you come one second\\r\\nafter midnight, it will be too late.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she had said this, her robe slipped from the traveller\\'s hand\\r\\nshe was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe industrious man hurried back to his friend, told him what the\\r\\nfairy had said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The idea!\" said the lazy, man, he laughed; \"of course, if we had a\\r\\nhorse there would be some chance, but _walk_ all that way? No, thank\\r\\nyou!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then good-bye,\" said his friend, \"I am off.\" And he set out, down the\\r\\nroad toward the shining castle, with a good steady stride, his eyes\\r\\nstraight ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lazy man lay down in the soft grass, looked rather wistfully at\\r\\nthe far-away towers. \"If only I had a good horse!\" he sighed.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust at that moment he felt something warm nosing about at his shoulder,\\r\\nheard a little whinny. He turned round, there stood a little\\r\\nhorse! It was a dainty creature, gentle-looking, finely built, and\\r\\nit was saddled bridled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hello!\" said the lazy man. \"Luck often comes when one isn\\'t looking for\\r\\nit!\" And in an instant he had leaped on the horse, headed him for\\r\\nthe castle of fortune. The little horse started at a fine pace, in a\\r\\nvery few minutes they overtook the other traveller, plodding along on\\r\\nfoot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you like shank\\'s pony?\" laughed the lazy man, as he passed his\\r\\nfriend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe industrious man only nodded, kept on with his steady stride,\\r\\neyes straight ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe horse kept his good pace, by noon the towers of the castle stood\\r\\nout against the sky, much nearer more beautiful. Exactly at noon,\\r\\nthe horse turned aside from the road, into a shady grove on a hill, and\\r\\nstopped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wise beast,\" said his rider: \"\\'haste makes waste,\\' all things are\\r\\nbetter in moderation. I\\'ll follow your example, eat rest a bit.\"\\r\\nHe dismounted sat down in the cool moss, with his back against a\\r\\ntree. He had a lunch in his traveller\\'s pouch, he ate it\\r\\ncomfortably. Then he felt drowsy from the heat the early ride, so he\\r\\npulled his hat over his eyes, settled himself for a nap. \"It will go\\r\\nall the better for a little rest,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat _was_ a sleep! He slept like the seven sleepers, he dreamed the\\r\\nmost beautiful things you could imagine. At last, he dreamed that he had\\r\\nentered the castle of fortune was being received with great\\r\\nfestivities. Everything he wanted was brought to him, music played\\r\\nwhile fireworks were set off in his honour. The music was so loud that\\r\\nhe awoke. He sat up, rubbing his eyes, behold, the fireworks were\\r\\nthe very last rays of the setting sun, the music was the voice of\\r\\nthe other traveller, passing the grove on foot!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Time to be off,\" said the lazy man, looked about him for the pretty\\r\\nhorse. No horse was to be found. The only living thing near was an old,\\r\\nbony, grey donkey. The man called, whistled, looked, but no\\r\\nlittle horse appeared. After a long while he gave it up, and, since\\r\\nthere was nothing better to do, he mounted the old grey donkey set\\r\\nout again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe donkey was slow, he was hard to ride, but he was better than\\r\\nnothing; gradually the lazy man saw the towers of the castle draw\\r\\nnearer.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it began to grow dark; in the castle windows the lights began to\\r\\nshow. Then came trouble! Slower, slower, went the grey donkey;\\r\\nslower, slower, till, in the very middle of a pitch-black wood, he\\r\\nstopped stood still. Not a step would he budge for all the coaxing\\r\\nscolding beating his rider could give. At last the rider kicked\\r\\nhim, as well as beat him, at that the donkey felt that he had had\\r\\nenough. Up went his hind heels, down went his head, over it went\\r\\nthe lazy man on to the stony ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere he lay groaning for many minutes, for it was not a soft place, I\\r\\ncan assure you. How he wished he were in a soft, warm bed, with his\\r\\naching bones comfortable in blankets! The very thought of it made him\\r\\nremember the Castle of Fortune, for he knew there must be fine beds\\r\\nthere. To get to those beds he was even willing to bestir his poor\\r\\nlimbs, so he sat up felt about him for the donkey.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo donkey was to be found.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lazy man crept round round the spot where he had fallen,\\r\\nscratched his hands on the stumps, tore his face in the briers, and\\r\\nbumped his knees on the stones. But no donkey was there. He would have\\r\\nlaid down to sleep again, but he could hear now the howls of hungry\\r\\nwolves in the woods; that it did not sound pleasant. Finally, his hand\\r\\nstruck against something that felt like a saddle. He grasped it,\\r\\nthankfully, started to mount his donkey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe beast he took hold of seemed very small, and, as he mounted, he felt\\r\\nthat its sides were moist slimy. It gave him a shudder, he\\r\\nhesitated; but at that moment he heard a distant clock strike. It was\\r\\nstriking eleven! There was still time to reach the castle of fortune,\\r\\nbut no more than enough; so he mounted his new steed rode on once\\r\\nmore. The animal was easier to sit on than the donkey, the saddle\\r\\nseemed remarkably high behind; it was good to lean against. But even the\\r\\ndonkey was not so slow as this; the new steed was slower than he. After\\r\\na while, however, he pushed his way out of the woods into the open, and\\r\\nthere stood the castle, only a little way ahead! All its windows were\\r\\nablaze with lights. A ray from them fell on the lazy man\\'s beast, he\\r\\nsaw what he was riding: it was a gigantic snail! a snail as large as a\\r\\ncalf!\\r\\n\\r\\nA cold shudder ran over the lazy man\\'s body, he would have got off\\r\\nhis horrid animal then there, but just then the clock struck once\\r\\nmore. It was the first of the long, slow strokes that mark midnight! The\\r\\nman grew frantic when he heard it. He drove his heels into the snail\\'s\\r\\nsides, to make him hurry. Instantly, the snail drew in his head, curled\\r\\nup in his shell, left the lazy man sitting in a heap on the ground!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clock struck twice. If the man had run for it, he could still have\\r\\nreached the castle, but, instead, he sat still shouted for a horse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A beast, a beast!\" he wailed, \"any kind of a beast that will take me to\\r\\nthe castle!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clock struck three times. And as it struck the third note, something\\r\\ncame rustling rattling out of the darkness, something that sounded\\r\\nlike a horse with harness. The lazy man jumped on its back, a very\\r\\nqueer, low back. As he mounted, he saw the doors of the castle open, and\\r\\nsaw his friend standing on the threshold, waving his cap beckoning\\r\\nto him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clock struck four times, the new steed began to stir; as it\\r\\nstruck five, he moved a pace forward; as it struck six, he stopped; as\\r\\nit struck seven, he turned himself about; as it struck eight, he began\\r\\nto move backward, away from the castle!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lazy man shouted, beat him, but the beast went slowly backward.\\r\\nAnd the clock struck nine. The man tried to slide off, then, but from\\r\\nall sides of his strange animal great arms came reaching up held him\\r\\nfast. And in the next ray of moonlight that broke the dark clouds, he\\r\\nsaw that he was mounted on a monster crab!\\r\\n\\r\\nOne by one, the lights went out, in the castle windows. The clock struck\\r\\nten. Backward went the crab. Eleven! Still the crab went backward. The\\r\\nclock struck twelve! Then the great doors shut with a clang, the\\r\\ncastle of fortune was closed for ever to the lazy man.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat became of him his crab no one knows to this day, no one\\r\\ncares. But the industrious man was received by the Fairy of Fortune, and\\r\\nmade happy in the castle as long as he wanted to stay. And ever\\r\\nafterward she was his friend, helping him not only to happiness for\\r\\nhimself, but also showing him how to help others, wherever he went.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDAVID AND GOLIATH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA long time ago, there was a boy named David, who lived in a country in\\r\\nthe Far East. He was good to look upon, for he had fair hair a ruddy\\r\\nskin; he was very strong brave modest. He was shepherd-boy\\r\\nfor his father, all day--often all night--he was out in the fields,\\r\\nfar from home, watching over the sheep. He had to guard them from wild\\r\\nanimals, lead them to the right pastures, care for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy by, war broke out between the people of David\\'s country a\\r\\npeople that lived near at hand; these men were called Philistines, and\\r\\nthe people of David\\'s country were named Israelites. All the strong men\\r\\nof Israel went up to the battle, to fight for their king. David\\'s three\\r\\nolder brothers went, but he was only a boy, so he was left behind to\\r\\ncare for the sheep.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the brothers had been gone some time, David\\'s father longed very\\r\\nmuch to hear from them, to know if they were safe; so he sent for\\r\\nDavid, from the fields, said to him, \"Take now for thy brothers an\\r\\nephah of this parched corn, these ten loaves, run to the camp,\\r\\nwhere thy brothers are; carry these ten cheeses to the captain of\\r\\ntheir thousand, see how thy brothers fare, bring me word again.\"\\r\\n(An ephah is about three pecks.)\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid rose early in the morning, left the sheep with a keeper, and\\r\\ntook the corn the loaves the cheeses, as his father had\\r\\ncommanded him, went to the camp of the Israelites.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe camp stood on a mountain on the one side, the Philistines stood\\r\\non a mountain on the other side; there was a valley between. David\\r\\ncame to the place where the Israelites were, just as the host was going\\r\\nforth to the fight, shouting for the battle. So he left his gifts in the\\r\\nhands of the keeper of the baggage, ran into the army, amongst the\\r\\nsoldiers, to find his brothers. When he found them, he saluted them and\\r\\nbegan to talk with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut while he was asking them the questions his father had commanded,\\r\\nthere arose a great shouting tumult among the Israelites, men\\r\\ncame running back from the front line of battle; everything became\\r\\nconfusion. David looked to see what the trouble was, he saw a\\r\\nstrange sight: down the slope of the opposite mountain came striding a\\r\\nPhilistine warrior, calling out something in a taunting voice; he was a\\r\\ngigantic man, the largest David had ever seen, he was covered with\\r\\narmour, that shone in the sun: he had a helmet of brass upon his head,\\r\\nhe was armed with a coat of mail, he had greaves of brass upon\\r\\nhis legs, a target of brass between his shoulders; his spear was so\\r\\ntremendous that the staff of it was like a weaver\\'s beam, his shield\\r\\nso great that a man went before him, to carry it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is that?\" asked David.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is Goliath, of Gath, champion of the Philistines,\" said the soldiers\\r\\nabout. \"Every day, for forty days, he has come forth, so, challenged\\r\\nus to send a man against him, in single combat; since no one dares\\r\\nto go out against him alone, the armies cannot fight.\" (That was one of\\r\\nthe laws of warfare in those times.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What!\" said David, \"does none dare go out against him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke, the giant stood still, on the hillside opposite the host\\r\\nof Israel, shouted his challenge, scornfully. He said, \"Why are ye\\r\\ncome out to set your battle in array? Am I not a Philistine, ye\\r\\nservants of Saul? Choose you a man, let him come down to me. If he\\r\\nbe able to fight with me, to kill me, then will we be your servants;\\r\\nbut if I prevail against him, kill him, then shall ye be our\\r\\nservants, serve us. I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a\\r\\nman, that we may fight together!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen King Saul heard these words, he was dismayed, all the men of\\r\\nIsrael, when they saw the man, fled from him were sore afraid. David\\r\\nheard them talking among themselves, whispering murmuring. They were\\r\\nsaying, \"Have ye seen this man that is come up? Surely if anyone killeth\\r\\nhim that man will the king make rich; perhaps he will give him his\\r\\ndaughter in marriage, make his family free in Israel!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid heard this, he asked the men if it were so. It was surely so,\\r\\nthey said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" said David, \"who is this Philistine, that he should defy the\\r\\narmies of the living God?\" And he was stirred with anger.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery soon, some of the officers told the king about the youth who was\\r\\nasking so many questions, who said that it was shame upon Israel\\r\\nthat a mere Philistine should defy the armies of the living God.\\r\\nImmediately Saul sent for him. When David came before Saul, he said to\\r\\nthe king, \"Let no man\\'s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go\\r\\nfight with this Philistine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Saul looked at David, said, \"Thou art not able to go against\\r\\nthis Philistine, to fight with him, for thou art but a youth, he has\\r\\nbeen a man of war from his youth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen David said to Saul, \"Once I was keeping my father\\'s sheep, and\\r\\nthere came a lion, a bear, took a lamb out of the flock; I\\r\\nwent out after the lion, struck him; delivered the lamb out of\\r\\nhis mouth, when he arose against me, I caught him by the beard, and\\r\\nstruck him, slew him! Thy servant slew both the lion the bear;\\r\\nthis Philistine shall be as one of them, for he hath defied the\\r\\narmies of the living God. The Lord, who delivered me out of the paw of\\r\\nthe lion out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the\\r\\nhof this Philistine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go,\" said Saul, \"the Lord be with thee!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he armed David with his own armour,--he put a helmet of brass upon\\r\\nhis head, armed him with a coat of mail. But when David girded his\\r\\nsword upon his armour, tried to walk, he said to Saul, \"I cannot go\\r\\nwith these, for I am not used to them.\" And he put them off.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he took his staff in his hwent chose five smooth stones\\r\\nout of the brook, put them in a shepherd\\'s bag which he had; his\\r\\nsling was in his hand; he went out drew near to the Philistine.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Philistine came on drew near to David; the man that bore\\r\\nhis shield went before him. And when the Philistine looked about saw\\r\\nDavid, he disdained him, for David was but a boy, ruddy, of a\\r\\nfair countenance. And he said to David, \"Am I a dog, that thou comest to\\r\\nme with a cudgel?\" And with curses he cried out again, \"Come to me, and\\r\\nI will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, to the beasts of\\r\\nthe field.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut David looked at him, answered, \"Thou comest to me with a sword,\\r\\nwith a spear, with a shield; but I come to thee in the name of\\r\\nthe Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast\\r\\ndefied. This day will the Lord deliver thee into my hand, I will\\r\\nsmite thee, take thy head from thee, I will give the carcasses\\r\\nof the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and\\r\\nto the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there\\r\\nis a God in Israel! And all this assembly shall know that the Lord\\r\\nsaveth not with sword spear; for the battle is the Lord\\'s, he\\r\\nwill give you into our hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then, when the Philistine arose, came, drew nigh to meet\\r\\nDavid, David made haste ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.\\r\\nAnd when he was a little way from him, he put his hin his bag, and\\r\\ntook from thence a stone, put it in his sling, slung it, and\\r\\nsmote the Philistine in the forehead, so that the stone sank into his\\r\\nforehead; he fell on his face to the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd David ran, stood upon the Philistine, took his sword, and\\r\\ndrew it out of its sheath, slew him with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.\\r\\nBut the army of Israel pursued them, victory was with the men of\\r\\nIsrael.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd after the battle, David was taken to the king\\'s tent, made a\\r\\ncaptain over many men; he went no more to his father\\'s house, to\\r\\nherd the sheep, but became a man, in the king\\'s service.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SHEPHERD\\'S SONG\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid had many fierce battles to fight for King Saul against the enemies\\r\\nof Israel, he won them all. Then, later, he had to fight against the\\r\\nking\\'s own soldiers, to save himself, for King Saul grew wickedly\\r\\njealous of David\\'s fame as a soldier, tried to kill him. Twice, when\\r\\nDavid had a chance to kill the king, he forbore to harm him; but even\\r\\nthen, Saul continued trying to take his life, David was kept away\\r\\nfrom his home as if he were an enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when King Saul died, the people chose David for their king, because\\r\\nthere was no one so brave, so wise, or so faithful to God. King David\\r\\nlived a long time, made his people famous for victory happiness;\\r\\nhe had many troubles many wars, but he always trusted that God would\\r\\nhelp him, he never deserted his own people in any hard place.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a battle, or when it was a holiday, or when he was very thankful\\r\\nfor something, King David used to make songs, sing them before the\\r\\npeople. Some of these songs were so beautiful that they have never been\\r\\nforgotten. After all these hundreds hundred of years, we sing them\\r\\nstill; we call them Psalms.\\r\\n\\r\\nOften, after David had made a song, his chief musician would sing with\\r\\nhim, as the people gathered to worship God. Sometimes the singers were\\r\\ndivided into two great choruses, went to the service in two\\r\\nprocessions; then one chorus would sing a verse of David\\'s song, the\\r\\nother procession would answer with the next, then both would sing\\r\\ntogether; it was very beautiful to hear. Even now, we sometimes do that\\r\\nwith the songs of David in our churches.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of his Psalms that everybody loves is a song that David made when he\\r\\nremembered the days before he came to Saul\\'s camp. He remembered the\\r\\ndays nights he used to spend in the fields with the sheep, when he\\r\\nwas just a shepherd-boy; he thought to himself that God had taken\\r\\ncare of him just as carefully as he himself used to care for the little\\r\\nlambs. It is a beautiful song; I wish we knew the music that David made\\r\\nfor it, but we only know his words. I will tell it to you now, then\\r\\nyou may learn it, to say for yourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.\\r\\n\\r\\n     He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; he leadeth me\\r\\n     beside the still waters.\\r\\n\\r\\n     He restoreth my soul; he leadeth me in the paths of\\r\\n     righteousness for his name\\'s sake.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of\\r\\n     death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod\\r\\n     thy staff they comfort me.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine\\r\\n     enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth\\r\\n     over.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Surely goodness mercy shall follow me all the days of my\\r\\n     life; I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE HIDDEN SERVANTS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a legend about a hermit who lived long ago. He lived high up on\\r\\nthe mountainside in a tiny cave; his food was roots acorns, a bit of\\r\\nbread given by a peasant, or a cheese brought by a woman who wanted his\\r\\nprayers; his work was praying, thinking about God. For forty years\\r\\nhe lived so, preaching to the people, praying for them, comforting them\\r\\nin trouble, and, most of all, worshipping in his heart. There was just\\r\\none thing he cared about: it was to make his soul so pure perfect\\r\\nthat it could be one of the stones in God\\'s great Temple of Heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, after the forty years, he had a great longing to know how far\\r\\nalong he had got with his work,--how it looked to the Heavenly Father.\\r\\nAnd he prayed that he might be shown a man--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Whose soul in the heavenly grace had grown\\r\\n      To the selfsame measure as his own;\\r\\n      Whose treasure on the celestial shore\\r\\n      Could neither be less than his nor more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he looked up from his prayer, a white-robed angel stood in the path\\r\\nbefore him. The hermit bowed before the messenger with great gladness,\\r\\nfor he knew that his wish was answered. \"Go to the nearest town,\" the\\r\\nangel said, \"there, in the public square, you will find a mountebank\\r\\n(a clown) making the people laugh for money. He is the man you seek; his\\r\\nsoul has grown to the selfsame stature as your own; his treasure on the\\r\\ncelestial shore is neither less than yours nor more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the angel had faded from sight, the hermit bowed his head again,\\r\\nbut this time with great sorrow fear. Had his forty years of prayer\\r\\nbeen a terrible mistake, was his soul indeed like a clown, fooling\\r\\nin the market-place? He knew not what to think. Almost he hoped he\\r\\nshould not find the man, could believe that he had dreamed the angel\\r\\nvision. But when he came, after a long, tiring walk to the village, and\\r\\nthe square, alas! there was the clown, doing his silly tricks for the\\r\\ncrowd.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hermit stood looked at him with terror sadness, for he felt\\r\\nthat he was looking at his own soul. The face he saw was thin tired,\\r\\nthough it kept a smile or a grin for the people, it seemed very sad\\r\\nto the hermit. Soon the man felt the hermit\\'s eyes; he could not go on\\r\\nwith his tricks. And when he had stopped the crowd had left, the\\r\\nhermit went drew the man aside to a place where they could rest; for\\r\\nhe wanted more than anything else on earth to know what the man\\'s soul\\r\\nwas like, because what it was, his was.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, after a little, he asked the clown, very gently, what his life was,\\r\\nwhat it had been. And the clown answered, very sadly, that it was just\\r\\nas it looked,--a life of foolish tricks, for that was the only way of\\r\\nearning his bread that he knew.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But have you never been anything different?\" asked the hermit,\\r\\npainfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clown\\'s head sank in his hands. \"Yes, holy father,\" he said, \"I have\\r\\nbeen something else. I was a thief! I once belonged to the most wicked\\r\\nbof mountain robbers that ever tormented the land, I was as\\r\\nwicked as the worst.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas! The hermit felt that his heart was breaking. Was this how he\\r\\nlooked to the Heavenly Father--like a thief, a cruel mountain robber? He\\r\\ncould hardly speak, the tears streamed from his old eyes, but he\\r\\ngathered strength to ask one more question. \"I beg you,\" he said, \"if\\r\\nyou have ever done a single good deed in your life, remember it now, and\\r\\ntell it to me\"; for he thought that even one good deed would save him\\r\\nfrom utter despair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, one,\" the clown said, \"but it was so small, it is not worth\\r\\ntelling; my life has been worthless.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell me that one!\" pleaded the hermit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Once,\" said the man, \"our bbroke into a convent garden stole\\r\\naway one of the nuns, to sell as a slave or to keep for a ransom. We\\r\\ndragged her with us over the rough, long way to our mountain camp, and\\r\\nset a guard over her for the night. The poor thing prayed to us so\\r\\npiteously to let her go! And as she begged, she looked from one hard\\r\\nface to another, with trusting, imploring eyes, as if she could not\\r\\nbelieve men could be really bad. Father, when her eyes met mine\\r\\nsomething pierced my heart! Pity shame leaped up, for the first\\r\\ntime, within me. But I made my face as hard cruel as the rest, and\\r\\nshe turned away, hopeless.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When all was dark still, I stole like a cat to where she lay bound.\\r\\nI put my hon her wrist whispered, \\'Trust me, I will take you\\r\\nsafely home.\\' I cut her bonds with my knife, she looked at me to\\r\\nshow that she trusted. Father, by terrible ways that I knew, hidden from\\r\\nthe others, I took her safe to the convent gate. She knocked; they\\r\\nopened; she slipped inside. And, as she left me, she turned and\\r\\nsaid, \\'God will remember.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That was all. I could not go back to the old bad life, I had never\\r\\nlearned an honest way to earn my bread. So I became a clown, must be\\r\\na clown until I die.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No! no! my son,\" cried the hermit, now his tears were tears of joy.\\r\\n\"God has remembered; your soul is in his sight even as mine, who have\\r\\nprayed preached for forty years. Your treasure waits for you on the\\r\\nheavenly shore just as mine does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As _yours_? Father, you mock me!\" said the clown.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the hermit told him the story of his prayer the angel\\'s\\r\\nanswer, the poor clown was transfigured with joy, for he knew that his\\r\\nsins were forgiven. And when the hermit went home to his mountain, the\\r\\nclown went with him. He, too, became a hermit, spent his time in\\r\\npraise prayer.\\r\\n\\r\\nTogether they lived, worked, helped the poor. And when, after\\r\\ntwo years, the man who had been a clown died, the hermit felt that he\\r\\nhad lost a brother more holy than himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor ten years more the hermit lived in his mountain hut, thinking always\\r\\nof God, fasting praying, doing no least thing that was wrong.\\r\\nThen, one day, the wish once more came, to know how his work was\\r\\ngrowing, once more he prayed that he might see a being--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Whose soul in the heavenly grace had grown\\r\\n      To the selfsame measure as his own;\\r\\n      Whose treasure on the celestial shore\\r\\n      Could neither be less than his nor more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more his prayer was answered. The angel came to him, told him\\r\\nto go to a certain village on the other side of the mountain, to a\\r\\nsmall farm in it, where two women lived. In them he should find two\\r\\nsouls like his own, in God\\'s sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the hermit came to the door of the little farm, the two women who\\r\\nlived there were overjoyed to see him, for everyone loved honoured\\r\\nhis name. They put a chair for him on the cool porch, brought food\\r\\ndrink. But the hermit was too eager to wait. He longed greatly to\\r\\nknow what the souls of the two women were like, from their looks he\\r\\ncould see only that they were gentle honest. One was old, the\\r\\nother of middle age.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently he asked them about their lives. They told him the little\\r\\nthere was to tell: they had worked hard always, in the fields with their\\r\\nhusbands, or in the house; they had many children; they had seen hard\\r\\ntimes,--sickness, sorrow; but they had never despaired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what of your good deeds,\" the hermit asked,--\"what have you done\\r\\nfor God?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very little,\" they said, sadly, for they were too poor to give much. To\\r\\nbe sure, twice every year, when they killed a sheep for food, they gave\\r\\nhalf to their poorer neighbours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very good, very faithful,\" the hermit said. \"And is there any\\r\\nother good deed you have done?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing,\" said the older woman, \"unless, unless--it might be called a\\r\\ngood deed----\" She looked at the younger woman, who smiled back at her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What?\" said the hermit.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill the woman hesitated; but at last she said, timidly, \"It is not\\r\\nmuch to tell, father, only this, that it is twenty years since my\\r\\nsister-in-law I came to live together in the house; we have brought\\r\\nup our families here; in all the twenty years there has never been a\\r\\ncross word between us, or a look that was less than kind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hermit bent his head before the two women, gave thanks in his\\r\\nheart. \"If my soul is as these,\" he said, \"I am blessed indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd suddenly a great light came into the hermit\\'s mind, he saw how\\r\\nmany ways there are of serving God. Some serve him in churches in\\r\\nhermits\\' cells, by praise prayer; some poor souls who have been very\\r\\nwicked turn from their wickedness with sorrow, serve him with\\r\\nrepentance; some live faithfully gently in humble homes, working,\\r\\nbringing up children, keeping kind cheerful; some bear pain\\r\\npatiently, for His sake. Endless, endless ways there are, that only the\\r\\nHeavenly Father sees.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so, as the hermit climbed the mountain again, he thought,--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"As he saw the star-like glow\\r\\n      Of light, in the cottage windows far,\\r\\n      How many God\\'s hidden servants are!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLITTLE GOTTLIEB\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAcross the North Sea, in a country called Germany, lived a little boy\\r\\nnamed Gottlieb. His father had died when he was but a baby, although\\r\\nfrom early morning till late at night his mother sat plying her needle,\\r\\nshe found it difficult indeed to provide food clothing shelter\\r\\nfor her little boy herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nGottlieb was not old enough to work, but he would often sit on a small\\r\\nstool at his mother\\'s feet dream about the wonderful things he would\\r\\ndo for his dear mother when he grew to be a man, she was comforted\\r\\nas she looked upon her boy, the thought that she was working for him\\r\\noften gave strength to her tired fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut one night Gottlieb saw that his mother was more than usually\\r\\ntroubled. Every now then she would sigh, a tear would trickle\\r\\ndown her cheek. The little boy had grown quick to read these signs of\\r\\ndistress, he thought, \"Christmas will be here soon, dear mother\\r\\nis thinking of what a sad time it will be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat would Gottlieb have given to be able to comfort his mother! He\\r\\ncould only sit brood, while his young heart swelled a lump rose\\r\\nin his throat at the thought that he could do nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently, however, a happy fancy came to him. Was not the Christ Child\\r\\nborn on Christmas Day, did not He send good gifts to men on His\\r\\nbirthday? But then came the thought, \"He will never find us. Our home is\\r\\nso mean small.\" It seemed foolish to hope, but a boy is not long\\r\\ncast down, as Gottlieb sat dreaming, a happy inspiration came to\\r\\nhim. Stealing softly from the room he took paper pen, for he had\\r\\nlearnt to write, spelt out, word after word, a letter which he\\r\\naddressed to the Christ Child.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may be sure that the postman was puzzled what to do with this letter\\r\\nwhen he sorted it out of the heap in the letter-box. Perhaps the\\r\\nBurgomaster would know the right thing to do? So the postman took the\\r\\nletter to the great burly man who lived in the big house wore a gold\\r\\nchain round his neck. The Burgomaster opened the envelope, as he\\r\\nread the letter written in the trembling hof a child, tears came\\r\\ninto his eyes. But he spoke gruffly enough to the postman, \"This must\\r\\nbe a foolish boy; a small one, I have no doubt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon Christmas morning dawned, Gottlieb woke very early. But others\\r\\nwere up before him, for, to his surprise, he saw a strange gentleman\\r\\nwith his mother. His wondering eyes soon perceived other unusual\\r\\nobjects, for the hearth was piled with wood, the table was loaded\\r\\nwith food dainties such as he had never even imagined.\\r\\n\\r\\nGottlieb entered the room just as his mother threw herself at the\\r\\nstranger\\'s feet to bless him for his generous goodness to the widow and\\r\\norphan. \"Nay, give me no thanks, worthy dame,\" said the visitor. \"Rather\\r\\nbe grateful to your little son, to the good Lord to whom he wrote\\r\\nfor aid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he turned to Gottlieb with a smile, \"You see that although you\\r\\nwrote to the Christ Child, your prayer for aid came only to the\\r\\nBurgomaster. The gifts you asked for are here, but they come from my\\r\\nhand.\" But Gottlieb answered him humbly, \"Nay, sir, the Christ Child\\r\\nsent them, for He put the thought in your heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW THE FIR TREE BECAME THE CHRISTMAS TREE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you stround the Christmas tree look longingly at the toys\\r\\nhanging from the prickly branches, it does not occur to you to ask why\\r\\nit is always this particular tree that is so honoured at Christmas. The\\r\\ndark green Fir looks so majestic when laden with bright toys lit up\\r\\nby Christmas candles, that perhaps it is not easy to believe that it is\\r\\nthe most modest of trees. But so it is, because of its humility it\\r\\nwas chosen to bear Christmas gifts to the children. This is the story:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Christ Child was born, all people, animals, trees, other\\r\\nplants felt that a great happiness had come into the world. And truly,\\r\\nthe Heavenly Father had sent with the Holy Babe His blessings of Peace\\r\\nGoodwill to all. Every day people came to see the sweet Babe,\\r\\nbringing presents in their hands. By the stable wherein lay the Christ\\r\\nChild stood three trees, as the people came went under their\\r\\nspreading branches, they thought that they, too, would like to give\\r\\npresents to the Child.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaid the Palm, \"I will choose my biggest leaf place it as a fan\\r\\nbeside the manger to waft soft air to the Child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I,\" said the Olive, \"I will sprinkle sweet-smelling oil over Him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can I give to the Child?\" asked the Fir.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You?\" said the others. \"You have nothing to offer. Your needles would\\r\\nprick the wee Babe, your tears are sticky.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis made the poor Fir very unhappy indeed, it said, sadly, \"Yes,\\r\\nyou are right. I have nothing that would be good enough to offer to the\\r\\nChrist Child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, quite near to the trees had stood an Angel, who had heard all that\\r\\nhad passed. He was moved to pity the Fir, who was so lowly without\\r\\nenvy of the other trees, he resolved to help it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh in the dark of the heavens the stars were beginning to twinkle, and\\r\\nthe Angel begged some of the little ones to come down rest upon the\\r\\nbranches of the Fir. This they were glad to do, their silvery light\\r\\nshone among the branches just like Christmas candles. From where He lay\\r\\nthe Christ Child could see the great dark evening world the darker\\r\\nforms of the trees keeping watch, like faithful guardians, beside the\\r\\nopen door of the stable; to its delight the Fir Tree saw the face of\\r\\nthe Babe illumined with a heavenly smile as He looked upon the twinkling\\r\\nlights.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Christ Child did not forget the lovely sight, long afterward he\\r\\nbade that to celebrate His birthday there should be placed in every\\r\\nhouse a Fir Tree, which might be lit up with candles to shine for the\\r\\nchildren as the stars shone for Him on His first birthday.\\r\\n\\r\\nWas not the Fir Tree richly rewarded for its meekness? Surely there is\\r\\nno other tree that shines on so many happy faces!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DIAMOND AND THE DEWDROP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA costly Diamond, that had once sparkled in a lady\\'s ring, lay in a\\r\\nfield amid tall grasses oxeye daisies.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust above it, was a big Dewdrop that clung timidly to a nodding\\r\\ngrass-blade.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverhead, the blazing sun shone in all his noonday glory.\\r\\n\\r\\nEver since the first pink blush of dawn, the modest Dewdrop had gazed\\r\\nfixedly down upon the rich gem, but feared to address a person of such\\r\\nexalted consequence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, a large Beetle, during his rambles, chanced to espy the\\r\\nDiamond, he also recognised him to be some one of great rank and\\r\\nimportance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sire,\" he said, making a low bow, \"permit your humble servant to offer\\r\\nyou greeting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tha--nks,\" responded the Diamond in languid tones of affectation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Beetle raised his head from his profound bow, his gaze happened\\r\\nto alight upon the Dewdrop.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A relative of yours, I presume, Sire?\" he remarked affably, waving one\\r\\nof his feelers in the direction of the Dewdrop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Diamond burst into a rude, contemptuous laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite _too_ absurd, I declare!\" he exclaimed loftily. \"But there, what\\r\\n_can_ you expect from a low, grovelling beetle? Away, sir, pass on! Your\\r\\nvery presence is distasteful to me. The _idea_ of placing ME upon the\\r\\nsame level--in the same family, as a low-born, mean, insignificant,\\r\\nutterly valueless----\" Here the Diamond fairly choked for breath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But has he not beauty exactly like your own, Sire?\" the Beetle ventured\\r\\nto interpose, though with a very timid air.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"BEAU--TY!\" flashed the Diamond, with fine disdain--\"the impudent fellow\\r\\nmerely apes imitates ME. However, it is some small consolation to\\r\\nremember that \\'Imitation is the sincerest flattery.\\' But, even\\r\\n_allowing_ him to possess it, mere beauty without _rank_ is ridiculous\\r\\nworthless. A Boat without _water_--a Carriage, but no _horses_--a\\r\\nWell, but never a _winch_: such is beauty without rank wealth! There\\r\\nis no _real worth_ apart from rank wealth. Combine Beauty, Rank,\\r\\n_and_ Wealth, you have the whole world at your feet. Now you know\\r\\nthe secret of the world worshipping ME.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Diamond sparkled gleamed with vivid, violet flashes, so that\\r\\nthe Beetle was glad to shade his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor Dewdrop had listened silently to all that had passed, felt\\r\\nso wounded, that at last he wished he never had been born. Slowly a\\r\\nbright tear fell splashed the dust.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then, a Skylark fluttered to the ground eagerly darted his beak\\r\\nat the Diamond.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Alas!\" he piped, with a great sob of disappointment. \"What I thought to\\r\\nbe a precious dewdrop is only a worthless diamond. My throat is parched\\r\\nfor want of water. I must die of thirst!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really? The world will never get over your loss,\" cruelly sneered the\\r\\nDiamond.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a sudden noble resolve came to the Dewdrop. Deeply did he repent\\r\\nhis foolish wish. _He could now lay down his life that the life of\\r\\nanother might be saved!_\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May _I_ help you, please?\" he gently asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lark raised his drooping head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my precious, precious friend, if you will, you can save my life!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Open your mouth then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Dewdrop slid from the blade of grass, tumbled into the parched\\r\\nbeak, was eagerly swallowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah--well, well!\" pondered the Beetle as he continued his homeward way.\\r\\n\"I\\'ve been taught a lesson that I shall not easily forget. Yes, yes!\\r\\nSimple worth is far better than rank or wealth without modesty and\\r\\nunselfishness--there is no _true_ beauty where these virtues are\\r\\nabsent!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"

    "Consider a city that is structured as a grid of intersections (each intersection can be thought of as a cell in a 2D list). A dog is positioned randomly at one of the intersections. The dog can move upwards, downwards, left, or right, and it cannot pass through the same intersection more than once. Write a program to simulate the random movements of the dog in this city. Calculate the probability of the dog exiting the city based on the given rules. To calculate the probability, you need to run the program a large number of times (for example, ten thousand times) and divide the number of times the dog successfully exits the grid by the total number of executions. This method of probability calculation is called Monte Carlo simulation. The dimensions of the city are taken from the user (number of rows and columns)."

At the end of winter, snow slowly covers the ground. The bare trees are stripped of their leaves and the cold air warms the hearts. Children in thick and colorful clothes come to the streets and play in the snow. For the nights, warm and orange tea makes people find comfort in the warmth of their homes. In this cold season, the earth turns white like a painting and nature turns into a fairy tale world!
